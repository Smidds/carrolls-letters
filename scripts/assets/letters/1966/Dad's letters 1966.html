Dear Mother, Aunt Clara and M.J. &amp; Bill, I waited to write until
we received your letter today. The boys say “Thank you” for their
cards. We took some pictures and will send some on later. I guess I
wrote about the birthdays. Like you folks we haven’t had much real
winter weather, although we’ve had our coldest weather the last few
days.  Our kids haven’t complained about the lack of snow, however.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We’re
home tonight although I may go shopping later and take this to the
post office. Ruth goes to a PTA board meeting tomorrow night. Wed is
choir practice and Ruth goes to Women’s Association luncheon on
Thurs. That evening we’re having some neighbors over for the
evening. Too bad about Mrs. Harbaugh. I know you have mentioned her
several times in your letters.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Andy
had the flu for awhile last week so Ruth stayed home from the choir
“twelfth night” dinner on Wed (in place of regular rehersal –
and after Christmas rather than before like we used to). We went to
one of the choir members homes and had a lot of fun. Last Thurs night
was Mariners board meeting. The old and new officers were there. I
think I told you that Ruth and I are the incoming “skippers”
(same as president) for the coming year. Mariners is the national
Presbyterian organization for couples with the emphasis on
strengthening the home. It uses nautical terms since it was started
in 1927 in a seaside town in California.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
were home Fri night. I finished painting the boys toy chest wagon
that grandpa made for them when he was here. He did a better job on
it than I would have. Sun morning was choir as usual. Sun evening was
installation of First &amp; Westminster Presbyterian Churchs Mariners
Officers at First church.  The district skippers come from Peoria to
lead the installation. At the entertainment afterwards I gave a few
tricks. It was the first time I’d given a public magic show in
about 10 years. It went OK.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Andy
feels OK now (Ruth got to go to the board meeting last Thurs) and we
all have been pretty free of sickness this winter so far. Ruth had
another appointment about her allergies today and I may have told you
she will have to take desensitization shots.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
Carbide situation is still up in the air. Dr. Cavalitto (our director
of research) is meeting in New York again (he was there a week ago)
and they are working on the administrative set-up of the
pharmaceutical work. Pharmaceutical work is at 5 sites, Decatur, 3
back east, and one at Brussels Belgium. It appears that it will be
consolidated at one site within 1½ to 2½ years. Decatur is still in
the running along with Tarrytown, NY – on the Hudson up from NY
City, or a new site. They hope to work that final decision out within
4-6 months. As I said I wouldn’t necessarily go East if a site
there, rather than Decatur, is chosen. This is just for research.
Production will definitely stay here.</FONT></FONT></P>

I’ll write this while I’m watching Andy in his bath. Our little
bathroom heater finally burned out so its cooler in the bathroom. The
little fan in it burned out but the wires still heated up. I think we
bought it in Kansas City when we moved into our first home.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tomorrow,
of course, is Ruth’s birthday. Part of her birthday is a new
rocker, which she picked out several days ago. The old rocker rocked
four babies so I guess it served its purpose. We finally had the
kitchen sink and bathroom shower installed. Ruth really enjoys the
sink, since the old faucet was almost completely worn out. I suppose
it was the original one (about 10-11 yrs) and our water is very hard
on the plumbing. Now we need a shower curtain. Our next job will be
to replace the bathroom lavatory and put in some storage space around
it. I’ll then paint the bathroom a more attractive color. They have
epoxy paint which is good to use over tile and where it may get wet.
We’re going ahead with a few things since it looks like we’ll be
here at least 3 years with the possibility that the research will all
eventually be located here. It will be a big decision so all the
advantages and disadvantages of various sites will probably be
carefully studied. As I said previously, even if things eventually
moved East that wouldn’t mean that I would definitely go.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>By
the time you get this you should have finally received the Christmas
box. Ruth had many delays as is always the case but all the gifts are
her “creations” except for Bill’s tie. Ruth will soon finish
knitting matching gold sweaters for Deloris Musgrave Berland and her
husband Steve. They are still in Manhatten where he is in school.
Deloris has really matured in recent years and I think the Laidigs
are now quite proud of her and her family. They often visit them.
Ruth is also almost done with a sweater for her Dad and then will
make one for her Mother. She is making me another sweater and I guess
that will about finish her year and several months of heavy knitting
although she’ll continue to do it. She really likes to do it. Ruth
has meetings on Tues and Thurs night meetings and we have choir on
Wed (I’ll have deacon’s meeting first). Yesterday was the
congregational dinner and meeting after church.</FONT></FONT></P>

- Didn’t finish this last night. I’ll mail the snapshots to you
soon. I was ready to mail them with this letter but Ruth wanted to
write the dates, etc. on them. Glad to have your letter. I also
bought Ruth a book of needlecraft for her birthday. We may have to
buy a new washing machine as the old one (8 years) is just about worn
out. Sorry to hear about Mrs. Harbaugh. We had company last Thurs
night. Ruth had shots yesterday morning and women’s association
last Thurs noon. She had PTA board Tues. Hope you’re all well –
we’re still free of colds.</FONT></FONT></P>

writing this with my new pen that I got for Christmas. Its a
cartridge type fountain pen and I think I write better with it than
with the ballpoint pens. I used up all the cartridges so I got a

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Received
Mother’s letter today and we were glad you all liked your gifts OK.
Ruth has her Mother’s sweater well under way and her Father’s is
essentially done. I’ve been wearing my new pull over blue sweater
in our cold weather. It’s been down to 4 or 5 degrees a couple of
times but I don’t think we’ve been below zero yet. Mother said
you had had a lot of snow, also. We’ve had less snow than almost
any winter I can remember. We had about an inch last Sat and that’s
about all we’ve had other than some flurries. The kids got all
muddy and their shoes covered with clay when they went over to a
neighbor’s to play. I don’t blame you for not wanting to drive
out on the slick streets.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
went to the creative writing (AAUW) group tonight at the library. I
stayed home, worked on Mariner (the national United Presbyterian
couples organization which Ruth and I are head of this year)
organization and then watched the second part of the CBS-TV National
Health Test. Last night I went to the annual Neisler Credit Union
(where I borrowed for our car etc.) meeting. I’m serving on the
board of directors for the coming year (meet once a month). Tomorrow
night is choir practice and I have a men’s dinner meeting Thurs
night. We usually try to stay home on Fri night. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>For

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Andy
has had some more temper spells recently, especially at mealtime but
he was better today. He wants to do everything for himself and, of
course, he can do a lot of things for himself. He’s a real
“contrary two.” He’s always asking where’s Mommy and where’s
Daddy so I don’t know how he’ll get along when I go to a meeting
in Chicago from Thurs to Sun Feb 3-6. Its the American College of
Cardiology and will be primarily MD’s but they will have some drug
related papers which will be what I’m going to hear.</FONT></FONT></P>

for the first time – that’s the Sun I’ll be gone. Last Sat I
spent about 5-6 hours cleaning the basement. It was in terrible
shape. A lot of magic is still mixed up and needs to be sorted. Sun
AM was s.s. and church as usual. Sun night we went to the Hofflands
where a couple that sings in the choir showed slides of their 2½
month trip through Europe last summer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Nothing
new at work. My new technician is working out real well. She’s not
quite 20 yet. The fellow I’ve had for over 2 yrs is 30 yrs old. He
recently got a good raise – up to $2.60 but still works 20-30 hrs a
week outside at a grocery store as a checker. He has two children and
also goes to night school.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>That
was nice that Norman Krause is Hutchinson’s Man of the Year. I
remember the name Gayle Sanders (Mother sent clipping) he was exactly
my age (2 wks younger). He was at Juco when I was. I have to write a
big report at work this week. It’s the first of regular monthly
progress reports that will circulate to the other labs doing
pharmaceutical research. Neisler vacation period is July 8-23 I
believe. Hope your weather is better.</FONT></FONT></P>

I’ll write this now and we’ll mail it on the way home from choir.
We’ll both be going tonight; Ruth went last week, and I stayed
home, when Lisa was running a fever. She missed two days of school
and Lesle missed one. Andy has a cold and touch of bronchitis. I left
work early and we all went to the Dr’s for check-ups. We’re still
going with the old washer. Ruth is looking at materials to make a new
slipcover for the couch. Its had five yrs or so of hard wear from the
kids and is beginning to show it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
go to Chicago in the early morning (6:49 AM plane) for that American
College of Cardiology meeting. Although it will be largely MD’s, I
thought it was nearby and I should take advantage of it, and see what
it is like. It will be in place of the April Federation Meetings in
Atlantic City (like I used to go to). Next year the Federation
Meetings are back in Chicago so I’ll go to it then. I’ll be
staying at the Conrad Hilton and will come back Sun PM. The weather
looks good for tomorrow. (I’m in charge of cardiovascular
pharmacology, you know?)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
had an 8 inch snow yesterday with some drifting. Arlene (my
technician) couldn’t make it in from where they live out in the
country. I shoveled off the driveway last night. We had Mariners
board meeting at our house Mon night. We had quite a bit to talk
about in starting to plan for the years program. We hope to have one
or two good service projects. Mariners is the nationally organized
couples (old or young) organization for United Presbyterians. The
Presbyterian Men and Women’s organizations are also, of course,
organized on a national basis.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Sun Rev Swan (the minister of visitation and evangelism) preached.
(Dr. Martin had already left) and then in the afternoon there was a
reception for him since he is retiring (he is in his 70’s). The new
minister Rev Stewart from Indianapolis is here now and will preach
Sun. I’ll miss it in the morning but will be back for his
installation service Sun evening, the choir will be singing.</FONT></FONT></P>

vice president of League of Women Voters for two yrs and I told her
it was agreeable with me since the possibility exists that we might
not be here beyond two more years. Glad to have your letter today.
Lucky nobody was hurt in the cab accident. Happy birthday to M.J. We
had 10 and 11 below and the electricity went off for awhile Sat
evening. We went on to bed and the temperature had fallen 6-7 degrees
before the electricity came back on. It was below 0 then so we were
lucky.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
guess I did alright on the medical test. I didn’t keep a paper
score. I guess I should know those things. Ruth was in charge of
several blocks for the March of Dimes Drive last Sun PM. She had to
get 14 women. It was very cold. Hope you’re all OK. I’ll try to
write from Chicago.</FONT></FONT></P>

As I said in my letter I’ll drop you folks a line from the “Windy
City.” I haven’t been outside the hotel since I arrived so I
don’t know how windy it is. We haven’t had any more snow up here
and the weather looks good for the trip home tomorrow. The meeting
has been satisfactory. All MD’s but I like to have an appreciation
of the ways MD’s (cardiologists) are thinking in regard to
cardiovascular drugs so I’m glad I came. There is, of course, no
one here that I know but I’ve seen some of the big names I’ve
heard about. I guess Paul Dudley White was here.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I’ve
called home and I guess Andy really wondered where Daddy was
yesterday morning. Ruth said he remembered I’d left on a plane so
he went to the front door to see if he could see. I guess the kids
will have to get used to it as I’ll probably have to travel
occasionally, especially while the Carbide labs are separated. I go
back tomorrow from 1:00-1:59 PM.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Wed night was choir practice and we both went after 2 wks of somebody
missing. I’ll miss church in the morning, but will be back for the
evening service. I’m going to try to go to the fifth annual Milikin
University Choir Concert at the Lake Shore Club for alumni. Its
tonight at 8:00. I’m sure I can get in even though I’m not an
alumnus. After all I know the director ha!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
trip up here was fine, but I almost missed the plane (6:49 AM). The
cab didn’t come, so we got everbody out of bed and made it with
seconds to spare. I would have missed a panel on some drugs if had
missed the plane. Hope you’re all OK and its beginning to warm up
some. I’ve had time to relax here since not all the meeting is of

</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I’ll
write this at work today since I didn’t get around to it last

called for some snow overnight. They now say we may get a little snow
this afternoon so we have again missed most of the snow that other
places got. We’ve just had that one big snow, you may remember, and
that’s about it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>My
Chicago trip was fine, although they were largely MD’s as I
explained, there were enough drug papers to make it interesting. If I
stay in my present position I probably should attend the same meeting
every 2-3 years. It meets every year. I have a PhD in pharmacology
from the University of Kansas. The confusing thing to other people is
that I got my masters from Dr. Wenzel in the School of Pharmacy in
Lawrence while the PhD is from the Department of Pharmacology at the
medical school in Kansas City (with Dr. Walaszek). Also, while
pharmacology is a basic medical science and is taught to both medical
students and pharmacy students, one can get a PhD from a medical
school department of pharmacology without having an MD. The PhD
pharmacologist if he teaches in a medical school may teach medical
students and graduates but, of course, cannot treat patients. An MD
may specialize in pharmacology and may also teach in departments of
pharmacology. In fact, most departments of pharmacology in medical
schools have both PhD’s and MD’s on the staff. PhD’s and MD’s
can both do medical research if they want too but PhD’s, of course,
cannot treat patients. I hope this clarifies the confusion that Mrs.
Van Zandt.</FONT></FONT></P>

for all the Valentines and for returning the pictures. A week ago
Tues night was that St. Olaf band which was excellent. Wed night was
choir practice. It warmed up some on Sat and Sun. I washed the car
Sun afternoon and put up our shower curtain Sat. Sun night was family
night at church. There were slides on Africa. Mon night I had an
Evangelism Committee meeting at church. I was the temporary deacons
representative until we choose 6 permanent members tonight. Last
night Ruth went to AAUW contemporary living a speaker on the theater.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Fri night was community concert but it was called off when the
scheduled singer had a bad throat. We had invited 3 couples in
afterwards, but only one made it. The Hofflands were too tired so
stayed home after they found the concert was cancelled. He had been
gone every night for a month. Mrs. Jensen took sick and they couldn’t
come. The third couple was the new minister (came last summer) at
First Presbyterian Church – he’s about my age. They came and we
had a nice visit. These are all “busy” people so we had hated to
invite them over except for a situation like after the concert.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tonight
is choir practice for Ruth and I have deacons meeting. I’m
secretary of the deacons. I think Ruth has a meeting tomorrow night
and we should be home Fri. Sat night is the first Mariners meeting –
an informal dessert at church. Ruth and I are in charge. Sun night is
family night again. Mon night is Mariners board meeting. Tues morning
Drs. Moffitt, Miller and I fly to New York (It will be my first visit
to the Carbide labs back there) for a pharmacology meeting a week
from today at the Sterling Forrest lab – out from New York 20-30
miles. We’ll come back Wed night. A week from Thurs night I’m in
charge of the men’s dinner at church honoring the boy scouts.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
hope to know within 30-60 days where the final consolidation of the
research will be. They say it is between Decatur and the Union
Carbide Research Institute labs at Tarrytown, New York (on the Hudson
River and out 20 mi or so from New York City). However, no one here
believes it will be in Decatur. Many have said they would not go to
Tarrytown and some have said they might consider it for a large
increase in salary; it would take considerably more money for the
higher cost of living and housing there. If the move takes place it
would probably be a year from June. I’m undecided but will start
putting a few job probes out in the Midwest. Its a very uncertain
time, but I guess it was inevitable in our situation.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Hope
M.J. and Bill get their house finished when they desire. We’ll be
looking forward to seeing it. If we have to make a move I hope we can
get a bigger house so the kids will have more play area. We’d like
a den too. I probably won’t write again until I get everything over
with next week. I believe this month will be our busiest month since
we’ve been in Decatur, for outside things, etc.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
has just about finished her Mother’s sweater and is now working on
one for Lesle. This winter so far has been the freest of colds etc.
that we’ve had in the last 2-4 years. I don’t believe other
people have been quite as sick either. With the recent retirement of
a man here I’m apparently the only registered pharmacist working
for Neisler here in Decatur. I suppose some of the salesmen are
registered. It doesn’t mean anything here but I have always kept my
registration up. I remember Ray Hockaday. Tell all hello. Ruth fixed
a fancy Valentine’s day dinner and table. The kids were thrilled
with their Valentines at school, of course.</FONT></FONT></P>

Aunt Clara, Mother, M.J. &amp; Bill, I’ll write this to you since I
called Mother the other night. Yesterday was not too cold but it
snowed almost all day. Most of the snow melted but some remained on
the ground overnight and melted today when it warmed up and cleared
off. As you know, we’ve only had the one big snow all winter. We’ve
hardly had any colds either which is probably due, at least in part,
to the lack of snow and severe cold.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I

improve.</FONT></FONT></P>

night we’re invited to the Robine Lee’s (he’s Chinese and is a
chemist at the lab). They have a new home just a few blocks from us.
Last Sun night was the last of the Family Nights at church. We met at
5:30 for dinner with all the family. The children stayed in for
devotions and then went to their own groups. Andy never ate very much
because there were so many people. The programs were on Africa and
India. Our new minister is fine and we are sure the church will be
coming alive before long, probably after we leave. We’re
disappointed that we probably won’t be here then.</FONT></FONT></P>

Sat night we went to Theater 7 (local drama group) to see “The Time

moderate the mens dinner at church honoring the scouts. About 80
there and I think it went OK. I was vice-president of the mens group
last year but never had to do very much. They have no new officers so
I had to have the meeting since the president was in Florida. The

active.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Thurs AM -</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
As usual, I’m slow getting around to this. It has warmed up some
yesterday and today so I expect spring will be here before long. We
had some snow last Fri and Sat. Tomorrow Ruth and I are driving to
Kankakee, Ill. I will be interviewing Armour Pharmaceutical Company.
They are, of course, part of Armour Packing Company. You would be
aware of the packing company, I’m sure. Armour has been in
pharmaceuticals for several years but their pharmacology has never
become outstanding. Armour plans to relocate their pharmaceutical
operations within a 30 mi radius of Chicago within the near future so
taking a job with them would mean renting in Kankakee until their new
plant is built. Regardless of where we go we’re going to try and
rent for awhile first.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>A
week from today and tomorrow I’m flying to Memphis, Tenn to
interview about a position there. Marion Laboratories is a small
pharmaceutical company (sales smaller than Neisler) with home offices
in Kansas City, Missouri. They have no research in Kansas City but
have a $100,000 a year contract with the University of Tenn in
Memphis (medical and pharmacy school) to carry out some research for
them. They are in need of another pharmacologist to do work similar
to what I’m doing now. It looks promising enough to look at first
hand. Although Memphis is not deep South it is definitely South and
I’ve always said I would not raise my children near the “Southern
Attitude.” There are only 3 small United Presbyterian USA churches
(like here) in Memphis with the Southern Church predominating. I, of
course, would prefer not to join a Southern Baptist Church, although
they have become somewhat more liberal recently. I doubt if there are
any American Baptist Churches in Memphis. Well anyway I’ll go see
what the job is. I’ll be there Thurs PM – overnight and all day
Fri.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
heard from Kansas City yesterday and there are no openings at Midwest
Research Institute. That is all contract work and one would probably
have severe deadlines to meet and could be quickly shifted around
depending on where the contract money is. I think it would probably
be wise for me to stay in industry, at least for now. There are
straight pharmacy school teaching jobs available at Southwestern
Oklahoma State at Weatherford (6-7,000 people in town) – West of
Oklahoma City, one at Ohio Northern, Ada, Ohio (4,000 people in Ada)
where Dr. Dave Stewart went. He was the Morman who used to work here.
Ohio Northern is a Methodist school. These would be straight teaching
jobs – no graduate students and no time for research except in the
summer. It would be a tremendous job the first year or so preparing
all the lectures. I think I’m better suited for research rather
than straight teaching. Medical school jobs, of course, combine less
teaching and more research but I don’t have the published research
reputation to do very well there at this point. Government money is
tighter now and most medical school jobs and advancement depend on
published research so I would be at a disadvantage. In industry you
do much work that is never published because the chemicals are not
patented.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tonight
is Community Concert – a male quartet. The one that was cancelled
will be held in April. I have a credit union board meeting right
after work. Tomorrow is Armour and I’m going to try and paint the
basement over the weekend. The big thing about moving is selling the
house. I just can’t imagine our having the entire house in perfect
order to show.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
night was choir practice. Tues night I stayed home while Ruth went to
PTA board meeting. Our school referendum (for increased taxes) was
defeated so there will be another one soon for a lessor amount. Last
Mon I flew to Chicago and interviewed Baxter Labs, Inc. Their
position looks real interesting and living wouldn’t be too bad in a
North Chicago area suburb. I hope to have an offer from them in 2-3
weeks. Baxter’s plant is in Morton Grove and the Milwaukee Road
train station is near the front door so some of them commute in by
train from Northern suburbs – you have to get to the station, of
course, but one might avoid having to buy a second car.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
have written G.D. Searle &amp; Co in Skokie (near Baxter) but haven’t
heard yet. They are older and bigger than Baxter but not as big as
Abbott in North Chicago or Lilly in Indianapolis. Upjohn is in
Kalamazoo, Mich (they are big) and Parke Davis in Ann Arbor and
Detroit. I have not contacted any of the latter.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Quick
transportation is easier from the Chicago area to Hutchinson than

I’ll go back to my old yellow pad today. Today is a little milder
after several cool days. The grass is greening up so we’ll have to
get out in the yard some before long. We were glad to have your
letter and clippings yesterday. I forgot to bring any of them this
morning so I’ll send the clippings later.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>This
week is less hectic than any of the past month. Last night I painted
some more on the basement walls (white). I’m about ¾ done and then
will have to paint the back hall and basement stairs. I should take
up the braided stair treads and have them cleaned and then relay
them. They have gotten quite dirty. We’re giving a lot of things
away to Goodwill and will also call the trash man to haul away a lot
of stuff. I can’t really get the basement in final shape before we
get the trash. I told them not to push the house until we get it in
better shape and they have only shown it once. We have it listed with
two realters but may go exclusively with one later and also cut the
price.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
kids had been begging to go to Hobby House Toy Store so we all went
last night after supper. The kids save up their own allowance money
and then like to pick out their own things. While I was painting
afterwards Ruth visited with that Mrs. Lewis (you met her – the
larger lady) to the East. They have been in Florida and also have a
new grandchild – their first. Ruth is still doing some knitting but
has now started to paint some of the dirtiest upstairs walls. The
upstairs is also a mess so we must get most of the painting done and
the house in order in case someone wants to see it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
kids will have three extra days of vacation at Easter time so they
will have a whole week off. These days were set aside as snow days
but didn’t have to be used because of the mild winter. You’re
still welcome to come around Easter if you would like. We’ll have
Good Friday music and the adult choir will be singing at both morning
services on both Palm Sun and Easter Sun. Ruth is going down today
for her regular shots (desensitization for her allergies); I guess
the’re doing her some good.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Sun was One Great Hour of Sharing – I expect you may have it. The
kids had put some money in their little offering boxes and took them
to church. I added some to what they had put in. Sun afternoon I
painted and we were home in the evening. Last Fri we all drove up to
Kankakee and I talked some more with Dr. Bastian, the head of
pharmacology at Armour Pharmaceutical Company.  The total sales of
Armour Pharmaceutical are about $25 </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>(plus
some zeros?)</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
compared to sales of over two billion for the entire corporation.
Union Carbide sales are over two billion while Neisler sales are
between five and six million.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>One
of the other fellows there drove Ruth and the kids around while we
talked. They also took us to lunch. The kids were pretty good. In the
afternoon we all drove to Park Forest (25 mi North on highway 54 –
4 lane all the way) where the Bastians live and Mrs. Bastian drove us
around to see some of the housing. We all ate out later and then Dr.
Bastian found us a motel and we stayed all night. Sat morning we
drove back and were here in time to go to “The Student Prince” in
the afternoon at Millikin University. We didn’t have a ticket for
Andy and couldn’t get a baby sitter so we took him and he was real
good. We were home Sat night.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Wed night was choir practice. A wk ago tonight was Mariners board
meeting. We’re getting a service project underway to help some at,
and help take high school kids out to Kemmerer Home – a
Presbyterian home for children South of here. After the board meeting
we went by the Hofflands to help celebrate Mrs. Hofflands birthday.
Both Presbyterian ministers were there, they had all been to a
concert by the Monmouth College Choir at First Presb Church. A wk ago
Mon I went to G.D. Searle in Skokie, Ill (North Chicago Suburb). It
was rough flying back but we missed the worst storms that had
developed in Ill that day.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>A
wk ago Sun afternoon I painted some and we had our Mariners Meeting
and potluck in the evening. The panel on family devotions was very
good. A wk ago Sat night was a party at the Garvers. He works here. A
wk ago Thurs and Fri was the Memphis trip and a week ago Wed was
Deacon’s Meeting and choir practice. I was home two wks ago on Mon
and Tues and I think I wrote last about then.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>At
the present time it looks like I’ll be taking the Armour position
and we’ll try to live in Park Forest. We’ll try to rent if we can
since I won’t take much money out of our present house. I haven’t
had a formal offer (some of the men were gone this week) from Armour
but he hoped it will come through next week. I had an offer for the
Memphis position. There you would be an Assistant Professor but do
research more like I’m doing here. It wouldn’t have the security
since the grant is from Marian Labs in Kans City and they could stop
it anytime. Hope you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

Dear Aunt Clara, Mother, M.J. &amp; Bill, Even though I called Mother
the other night I suppose I should get a Hutchinson letter off this
week, and I guess its time I directed one to you first. Today is
rainy and cold again. I don’t think spring is ever going to get
here. I guess its better, however, as far as selling the house since
I’m sure a lot of people haven’t been out looking because of the
cool weather. We’ll be looking forward to seeing M.J. and Bill’s
house. As I told Mother, unless there is a sudden change in our
plans, we’ll probably be in Kansas the last part of June.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
started painting the girls room yesterday and should finish today.
Except for some touching up of spots we’re about done with the
upstairs painting we wanted to do. Some of the walls were quite
soiled from the kids dirty hands. I finished painting the basement
walls (white) a week ago Sat, and now that the basement is pretty
well arranged it looks a lot better. The original paint on the
basement walls (painted before we came) was faded and dirty and there
were several bad spots so it really needed. I finished painting the
inside of the garage Sat PM. I had never painted it and it really
needed it. I want to paint the basement stairs and the walls above
and touch up a few other spots and that will about do it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>This
letter will have to be our formal Easter greeting to all in
Hutchinson since we didn’t get any cards off. We hope you had a
nice dinner and time on Easter. We were at home last night and I
worked on income tax. I guess we’re at home again tonight and then
choir practice again tomorrow night. The choir sang at both morning
services on both Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>A
week ago last night Ruth and I went to see “My Fair Lady.” That’s
the movie that won several academy awards a year ago. A week ago
tonight we went to the church (the whole family) to hear the college
choir from the College of the Ozarks (a small college South of
Springfield, Missouri at Point Lookout, Missouri); it was directed by
a man who used to be here at Millikin in graduate school and who was
our assistant choir director at church. Last Wed night was choir
practice and then Ruth and I went to communion on Thurs night. Fri
night the adult choir sang several numbers at the veiling of the
cross service. The children went to that. Sat afternoon Ruth took the
3 older children to see “My Fair Lady” while I painted. We were
home Sat night. Hope you’re all well.</FONT></FONT></P>

We may receive a letter from Hutch today but I’ll go ahead and
write this now. I guess neither one of us have been writing quite as
often as we used to. I’m hoping that the May will be a little more
relaxing and we can get back on our original schedule. Today is
warmer and clear after 2-3 days of cooler, rainy weather. The grass
is really growing; I haven’t cut it yet.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Some
of the Carbide people were here on Tues and Wed and we had several
meetings. I guess there is a possibility that the Carbide man that
has messed everything up</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>could
be removed from his present position as head of all the research and
development. He is a chemist with no pharmaceutical experience. They
should have put Dr. Cavallito (he is going to the University of North
Carolina – Chapel Hill, NC as Professor of Medicinal Chemistry) in
charge of all the research but they decided not to, and it is to late
to change things now. Pete Luna, my technician, went up to Armours
yesterday for an interview but he is undecided about what he should
do. My other technician, Arlene, says that her husband is planning to
go to California in June so she will probably leave in July.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
total sales of Armour Corporation (meats, foods, fertilizer,
chemicals, etc) is about $2,000,000,000 and about the same as Union
Carbides. However, the sales of Armour Pharmaceutical Co (part of
Armour Corporation) are about $25,000,000 while Neislers sales are
$6,000,000. The position at Armour is somewhat of a gamble but
appeared to have more long term future for me than a job at the
biggest pharmaceutical companies $100,000,000 - $300,000,000 sales a
year. The Armour job is certainly less of a gamble than staying at
Neisler – even if they make some drastic changes in the near
future.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
just finished painting our bedroom so the bathroom is the only major
refinishing job left. I’ll try to start on it this weekend. We have
the house listed with 3 realters but its only been shown about twice.
I heard from Armour this week that they will pay the 6% real estate
fee on selling the house so that will help us if we need to negotiate
the price down some to facilitate a sale. We will hopefully have
enough for a down payment on a new house in the $25,000-30,000 range.
(We’re listing our present house at $21,900 to start.)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
painted some last weekend and then on Sun night we had the Mariners
meeting (a local theater group gave a religious play). Mon night was
Mariners board meeting. Tues night I had dinner with the Carbide
people and Ruth had a meeting. Wed was choir. (I resigned from the
Board of Deacons – it met Wed). Last night I went to my first PTA

write this now and maybe drive downtown later and mail it. I’ll
enclose some pictures that I picked up yesterday. I just finished
mowing the yard for the first time. I started Fri evening and did
some yesterday AM also. It started raining about 11:00 yesterday AM
so I had to quit then. The grass had gotten so high that I had to do
quite a bit of raking.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
sent my letter of resignation in this past week. I said I would
terminate June 15</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
if agreeable with them but since I hadn’t sold our house that I
might be available for an indeterminate period of time after that.
We’ve only shown the house about 3-4 times even though it is listed
with 3 realty companies. The salesmen of another company will be out
this week. Even though its supposed to be a sellers market in Decatur
I’m guessing we’ll have some trouble. Our major assets are a good
floor plan, a full basement and the ½ acre lot. However, we’re at
a major disadvantage with only 1 bathroom. Practically all newer
houses (we’re 11 yrs old now) in our price range have 1½ - 2
bathrooms. We, of course, would have planned to add one someday. (Not
being in the city is somewhat of a disadvantage.) Armour will pay the
6% realty fee which will really help if we have to cut the price much
in order to sell. Since we have an FHA (Federal Housing
Administration) insured loan (the government insures low down payment
loans) we don’t have much equity in the house so their paying the
real estate fee will help a lot.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>At
this time I wouldn’t plan on us definitely making it to Kansas in
June. It will all depend on when we sell the house etc. Fortunately
Armour is not too particular about when I arrive since they have to
get some equipment and rearrange things for my lab. I had said I
would try to be there by July 1</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>st</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
but I suppose they would agree to some delay. I hate to leave the
family here and go on up alone until the house sells. Another
possibility is to rent the house for awhile but I’ll try to avoid
that if I can. I’ll have 2 wks vacation pay coming whenever I leave
but another possibility is to start right in at Armour and then they
would give me a two week leave of absence without pay later in the
summer. Armour will pay our motel expenses for one week while we look
for housing and will, of course, pay moving expenses. Again, as of
now, I can’t say when our vacation will be so you’re welcome to
come ahead for a few days visit if you want to.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Today
is quite cool and was cloudy until now (6:00 PM). I softened the
water this afternoon. This weeks schedule is lighter. In place of
choir practice on Wed night we’ll go to a Milliken U music festival
concert. A week ago yesterday we cleaned up things thinking they
might want to show the house but nobody called. Last Sun afternoon I
started to redecorate the bathroom. We had purchased some new epoxy
(waterproof) paint, which is good where there is moisture, and its
also good over tile. I had to remove the paint above the tile and it
was quite a job. I had never used epoxy paint or paint remover before
and they are both hard to work with. I worked some Mon night and then
finished the job Tues when I stayed home from work. I finished in
time for us to go to the last Community Concert (a tenor –
scheduled earlier but he was sick) Wed night was choir and Thurs
night I went to the men’s dinner at church honoring the high school
graduates. Fri night we ate at the drive-in.</FONT></FONT></P>

kids. It’s harder to get them to bed in the evening since its
getting lighter in the evening. I go for my physical this afternoon;
this is for Armour &amp; Co – they said I could go ahead and take
it here. I am definitely terminating here on June 15</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
so I suppose we go ahead and take our vacation the last two weeks in
June and I’ll try to start work around July 1</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>st</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>.
I had originally promised that I would be available around July 1</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>st</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
so I’ll try to hold to that date. Dr. Bastian (head of
pharmacology) at Armour is watching the Park Forest papers for rental
housing. There are not many available and they are quickly snatched
up when they do occur. If he sees one that looks good he will let us
know (after his wife looks at it) and we will try to drive up to see
it. He called about a house the other day but we both agreed that it
probably didn’t have enough room (we didn’t drive up). We have to
only consider renting until such time as we sell the house. Mortgage
money is tighter now and interest rates are higher.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tomorrow
night is choir and Thurs night we’re having a new fellow here over
for dinner. He is to work in the medical department (the 3 original
people are leaving and this man was transferred from somewhere else
within Union Carbide) and he left his family back East. He goes home
every two weeks. Next Sun night is Mariners meeting at church. We
have an open house this Sun with another real estate company and
then, if there is no luck, we’ll give it exclusive to the company
that had the open house last Sun.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Wed night we went to the orchestra concert at Millikin U. It was part
of the annual contemporary music festival week which they have. Choir
practice was called off so we could go. Fri night we took the whole
family to the band concert at Milliken. Sat all day I worked around
the house getting ready for the open house on Sun. Sat evening we
were invited out to a friends house. The minister and his wife were
the other couple there.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Sun
AM I finished cleaning the basement before we went to church. We came
back home after church and finished things up and then ate at a
drive-in. We then went to a senior girl (at Milliken and works at
church in music) organ recital and then home awhile and then all ate
out at the Redwood place (smorgasbord). Hope you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Thurs AM –</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
I’ll try to get this letter off this time, rather than calling.
Yesterday and today have been clear after a rainy spell. We’re
beginning to have some real summer-like days, also. I suppose we’ll
want to get the air conditioner put in the window before too long. As
I said over the phone we went up to Park Forest last Fri and looked
at housing. We stayed all night at the Bastians and came back Sat
afternoon. Ruth and the older kids had tickets for a dance revue at
Millikin (a lot of children performed) but we didn’t get back in
time. We did get back in time to go to the Theater 7 (local dramatic
group) production of “Kiss Me Kate” (Broadway show). They had
brought a man from New York to play the lead and direct. The lights
went out during the show so it was almost midnight when we got home.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Sun
AM was the usual schedule. I mowed some in the afternoon and then we
had a choir appreciation dinner and program at church. The kids went
also. Lisa now has her glasses and, I believe, is getting used to
them. Alan has been somewhat of a discipline problem recently. We
suspect that the prospect of moving may be causing some of it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
had a meeting Tues night and we went to choir practice last night. I
was to go to the mens dinner at church tonight but there were so few
reservations that they called it off. Things are easing up now and I
need the time to wind up some work here. I’m trying to get all my
data together for a paper.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
don’t know our plans for June as yet. I still terminate June 15</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>.
We’re still waiting to hear about our house. Our prospect is
supposed to notify the realter this week. We almost rented a house
but it was near a railroad and Alan and Andy are wanderers and love
trains, and there was no fenced in yard so we decided not to take it.
If we sell our house now we might buy. I don’t know yet. We were
glad to have your letter and the gift. I’ll let you know what we do
with it. Glad to hear all the Hutch news. Hope you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

– We were glad to have your usual letter. I don’t have it with me
so I can’t recall about any questions you may have asked. We sold
our house to the party we mentioned. He is assuming our mortgage
payments (this saves costs on both sides) so we would still be
responsible if, for any reason, he could not make his payments. He
would appear to be a good risk, however, since he has a good job at
Caterpiller. He is being transferred from Peoria and started here
full time on June 1</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>st</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>.
He wants to move in by July 1</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>st</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
so we are going to look at housing tomorrow in Park Forest. We have a

there this evening after work.</FONT></FONT></P>

or 18</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>.
We would go to Oberlin first so Ruth can be with her father on
Father’s Day. Our closing for the house will be sometime near the
end of the month, probably after we get back. I have been busy at
work getting my data and paper together. I may not get it done, but
can finish it after I leave, I guess. I sorta remember Don Stiles,

332 Minocqua, Park Forest, Ill - Dear Hutchinson Folks, We were glad
to have your letter here yesterday. Yes, I think we had a nice time
in Hutchinson. We had a good trip back. We ate supper in Topeka after
calling our friends and finding they were not at home. We then drove
to see the tornado damage; it was certainly as bad as the pictures
and stories indicated. We then drove on to K City where we missed the
Moyes that evening by 5 mins – we saw them the next AM and left
about noon. Got home about 10:00 after stopping in Columbia, Mo and
North of St. Louis for supper. The packer didn’t come on Tues so we
had time to get things ready. He came Wed and the van Thurs. It was 6
before they finished. We cleaned late and stayed in the motel. Got
here about 1:00. They had already started to unload. We have a garage
or we would really be crowded. Has been very hot and lots of work
unpacking, etc.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Sat PM - </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>As
usual, I meant to write a letter sooner. I believe we’re finally
getting on to the schedule. We’re getting up about 6:30 which is
about a half hour earlier than we used to. We have 5 in the current
carpool but I don’t know how it will finally evolve. Dr. Jim
Bastian (my boss – head of pharmacology, about 39-40 years old –
3 children) is riding now but I don’t know whether he will
continue, or not. Pete will be coming about August 1</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>st</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
(his furniture is somewhere here in one of the Co-op Townhouses but I
don’t know where – I missed seeing him by 5 mins the day we
moved. He is taking his vacation in Mexico where one of his older
brothers is seriously ill.) and he will be wanting in the carpool.
I’ve driven twice (about 60-65 mi total both ways counting the
pick-up of the other people). Takes about 30-35 minutes one way but
its not bad since you are conversing with the other people in the
car.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
job, so far, is exactly as I had anticipated and I feel I can learn a
lot and make a real contribution since some of the things we will set
up have not been done here before. Jim and the other pharmacologists
are more oriented towards hormones, enzymes and blood clot work but
they have done some work related to the type I’ve been doing at
Neisler. I hope to learn about and maybe do some work on the lung.
I’ve always wanted to work in this area and its closely related to
cardiovascular, where I spent most of my time working at Neisler.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>As
far as I know our loan was approved this week by First Federal
Savings &amp; Loan of Chicago. If everything goes as agreed on,
closing will be Aug 22 and we will own the house Sept 1</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>st</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>,

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Today
we drove down to the Museum of Science &amp; Industry. It was a
perfect day for an outing – clear and temp in the 80’s. (The
weather the last few days has been perfect after, like yours, the hot
humid stretch – I hope you all got relief also and that Aunt Clara
is now feeling better.) We had lunch at the museum and then lasted
until about 4:30. Andy got very tired (he took a nap as we carried
him around) and irritable, but the other kids wanted to stay until
closing time at 5:30. As you remember, the Museum is not far from the
U of Chicago. I suppose my dad went there many times when he was at
the University. Did you ever have the addresses of where he lived and
the shoe store where he worked. We drove by Blackstone St. Didn’t
Aunt Margaret live on that street at one time. I vaguely remember
going to the Museum that summer we went to visit them. If we drove by
the University of Chicago in 1944 that was only 2 years after the
first experiments were performed under the Stagg Field Stadium which
led to the development of nuclear energy and the atomic bomb. The
University is within a mile of the Museum. We drove back home on
South Lake Shore Drive and went through Hammond, Ind, and then came
back over here – a longer way than the way we went this morning.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We’ll
probably go back to the Museum another time since we didn’t begin
to see everything. The Williams reunion is in Mich this year (it
alternates between there and that town in Ind where the covered
bridges are and where Ruth’s Grandmother is buried), and is near
Benton Harbor which wouldn’t be to far from Aunt Margaret. One
weekend we want to take a trip to Detroit to see Deerfield Village
(Detroit is about a 5-6 hour drive). We’ll probably stay all night
on that trip. Helen and Dale Johnson, Ruth’s friends (they used to
live in Oberlin, and taught under Mr. Laidig) in Evanston, are people
we might want to see some Sat also. The Brookfield Zoo is another Sat
possibility, as is the aquarium and art museum.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
guess we brought bad luck to Chicago. We had 3 tornado alerts here
just after we came, including one in the middle of the night (some
damage in the suburbs); the recent riots (we did not drive through
the riot area today) </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>(The
“West Side Riot” began on July 12 after police and African
American youth clashed over the youth opening fire hydrants and
playing in the water.)</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>;
and the terrible murders (on the way home I believe we drove within a
mile or so of where they occurred) </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>(Richard
Speck tortured, raped and murdered eight student nurses from South
Chicago Community Hospital on the night of July 13 into the early

They announced today that they think they know who did it, but he has
not been caught. The riots have been near the west-side medical
center area so I guess I’m glad I’m not working there now.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
is planning to visit (with the kids, of course) her good friend who
used to live in Decatur and who lives in a nearby suburb. A lot of my
equipment at work has not arrived as yet so it will probably be
sometime in Aug before I start running expts. I need my birth
certificate for the Armour Pension Plan. If you have it you can send
it to me. Otherwise fill out the 3 unanswered yes &amp; no questions
to the best of your ability and send the paper back to me and I’ll
send it to Topeka. I’ve never had real occasion to have my birth
certificate before this.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Don’t
you have an insurance policy for me that you used to pay for. If you
still have it why don’t you send it to me sometime. We haven’t
heard from the Laidigs for some time, but we assume that they are OK.
Andy is making progress in the bathroom area so we haven’t given up
hope. The kids are all fine and have quite a few neighborhood friends
(more than they had in Decatur). We have a yard (I mowed it once –
much smaller than Decatur) but we don’t water. We have no good
window for the air conditioner. Hope you’re all OK and Aunt Clara
is feeling better and M.J. and Bill got around OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Sun 5:00 PM -</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
Dear Aunt Clara, Mother, M.J. &amp; Bill, I’ll send this to you
since I don’t believe you have had a letter from us since we came
to Park Forest. I’ll send some clippings to Mother. We’ll mail
this tonight but I believe the last Park Forest pick-up is at 2:30 so
it probably won’t go out until morning. However, mail is probably
just as fast from here to Hutch as from Decatur since we’re on the
direct train route from Chicago to Hutch.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
clippings show the townhouses where the murder occurred. In Chicago
the’re usually called townhouses or flats, but in Kansas they would
probably just be called apartments. You find many of them very close
together as you go closer into the city where the population density
is higher.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
called her folks the other night since we had not received a letter;
they were fine – I don’t know when they will plan to visit us.
Thanks to Mother for sending the hospital birth certificate. I hope
it is adequate for Armour (its for my pension plan); they might
require a state certificate, which would mean sending in those
applications to Topeka. Everything at work is fine. I’m going to
write my first report by the first of Aug. I haven’t done any
experiments since the equipment has not all arrived, but there are
some things to write about. Pete Luna (my technician) has not yet
arrived, as far as I know, but should show up this week. I may have
another new employee under me at least part of the time. He has a
B.S. and started about 2 weeks before I did.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Hope
you’re all feeling OK and the weather is not too hot. It is much
warmer and humid here today so the kids were in the pool (I bought it
last Mon night for them) for 2 hrs. We all went to s.s. and church
this morning as usual. We may go shopping a bit this evening and then
back home for popcorn. We drove across to the museum on 55</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
street so we went about 3 blocks from the old Lester house. I’ve
forgotten, did my dad stay with the Lesters part of the time he was
at the University.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Yesterday
we went to the Brookfield Zoo (we went once when we were in Franklin
Park). It was a warm, not hot, day so we stayed until 4:30, and ate
on the way home. Fri night we went to see Mary Poppins for the second
time (saw it in Decatur). Ruth took the kids and visited a friend in
Hazelcrest (a suburb North of here) last week. A neighbor had a
coffee one morning. The minister called Wed evening. It sure is nice
Mother and you both have air conditioners for the hot weather. Yes,
Mother, I could carry on that policy. Ruth taught s.s. adult class
this AM and will next Sun.</FONT></FONT></P>

It’s been thundering and lightening for some time this evening, but
it hasn’t rained much so far. It has cooled off some after being
hotter today. The kids played in the pool (about a foot deep) this
afternoon after Ruth cleaned it this AM. I’ve had a cold, the first
one in many months, the last few days, but it is better today. The
kids and Ruth are all OK. I don’t believe we have much scheduled
this week. Next Sun after church we’re driving to Carol and Jack
Duvalls in a suburb which is quite a distance from here. Yesterday we
took the Lunas to church. His father is a Presbyterian minister in
Mexico, but they didn’t go much in Decatur when he was working the
second job. After church we stopped at their place to see how they
were settled. They live in one of the cooperative townhouses, and
have a basement storage area, a living dining room and kitchen on the
first floor and two bedrooms and a bath upstairs. Their place looked
real nice and I hope they are happy. They have people on both sides
but they say the noise is not too bad. After seeing their place they
came over to our place and Pete and I went out for food and we all
ate here, along with dessert at the end. (Its finally raining some
now.) They stayed until about 3:00. We rested and then I mowed the
grass (the second time) so we could play croquet after supper.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
stayed home last Sat. Ruth shopped alone for several hours on the
plaza including some time at Marshall Fields. Later in the afternoon
she took Alan out for a new pair of shoes. Didn’t do much last week
other than the regular things. Pete and Linda (their children are
Jeff and Laura) showed up Wed night. They had arrived on Tues. He had
driven 12,000 miles going to Mexico but he got to see his parents and
the other relatives that he hadn’t seen for several years. He has
quite a bit of debt so I hope he gets along OK here. At his level it
was hard for him to relocate. He left his wife and children in
Phoenix, Arizona while he went on into Mexico.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
would say that Aunt Margaret is about the same time from here as it
would be to Aunt Nellie’s. Probably 3-4 hrs to Aunt Margaret. We
could go up on a Sat and back on a Sun sometime. Glad to have your
letter. Hope M.J. and Bill have a nice vacation. Ruth did a fine job
at the s.s. class. Hope you’re all OK and its cooler.</FONT></FONT></P>

Lisa and I are just about ready to take Spotty to get his annual
rabies shot. We smelled a skunk last night while he was outside; it
reminded us that we had not taken him in this year. I’m driving the
car pool tomorrow. I drive about 66-69 miles on the day I drive
depending on whether I have to pick everyone up or not. We worked on
our first dog today. Our major pieces of equipment (about $15,000
worth) are here and Pete was pleased that he could now run an
experiment. At least for now, I have another fellow (Joe Williams –
recent college graduate) under me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Thanks
for sending the write-ups about Alvin Coons. I remember him and would

afternoon both here and at Kankakee, but has cleared off this
evening. We have had pretty nice weather recently. We got our
mortgage OK. Apparently one of the last 90% (10% down) loans in the
area. Money is tight and you usually need 20% down. Closing will be
sometime the end of the month and we should know by the 15</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>

Chicago – about 75 mi from here) to Carol and Jack Duvall and
family (Carol is Ruth’s good friend from school at Oberlin). Jack
was working an extra job since he is an airline mechanic and is on
strike. Carol has been working also. We got there about 12:30 – ate

the International division) in our carpool quit Armour a week ago
Friday. This leaves the 4 men. We’ve been taking a regular day each
week and alternating the fourth day. The carpool has worked fine
although I will be farther away from the others after we move. An
Armour fellow lives just around the corner from the other house but
he’s in a carpool that has been the same group for 6 yrs. The young
fellow in our pool is married but has no children and is classified
1-A for the draft and might be called sometime. Joe Williams, the BS
fellow who has been working some with me is also 1-A (not married)

after it had warmed up. She had to make it larger, of course. She is
knitting a sweater for Mrs. Rev Moyes in Kansas City (the one who had
surgery – the man). No reason other than she just wanted to do it.
Ruth is playing the piano at this time. She has practiced more here
in Park Forest than at any time since we have been married. We had
the piano tuned not long ago, but it may have to be done again after
we move.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
last we heard closing for our house will be the first week in Sept

and 15</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>.
The real estate man is not charging us rent after the first and as I
probably told you is paying our moving expenses over to the other
house. The other people bring our mail by once a week from over
there. I transferred magazines etc to that address. The house we’re
in right now has been sold, so there will be 5 families moving all at
the same time. The kids may have to start school a few days before
the move so they will have to be taken over by car since its too far
to walk from here. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
remember walking it a few times.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
just says she finished that blanket she started at your house. I
think you’re doing the right thing in thinking about getting rid of
the apartment. I just don’t think you can look after it properly as
you get older. We thought about Aunt Margaret when we went over into
Michigan to that Williams reunion. It was 100 miles from our house to
the reunion site (about 15-20 mi from Berrier Springs, and 5-10 miles
from St. Joseph). It took us a little over 2 hrs. We still plan to go
to Detroit (about 300 miles) sometime to visit the Ford museum and
Deerfield Village. Our plans also call for a weekend trip to Decatur
sometime in Sept. The Laidigs may stop by here on their way back from
Canada in October (Mr. L is up there on highway business). You plan
to come anytime after we get over in the other house. We would meet
you downtown at the station, of course.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Next
Sat night is our s.s. class party at the assistant ministers yard. We
have a babysitter. I don’t know whether we’ll go anywhere else
next weekend or not. We don’t usually go out on the highway on
holiday weekends, so we’ll probably be home on Labor Day. Last Sat
we left about noon for Wis. We ate sandwiches along the way and with
one stop for dessert were in Madison by a little after 4:00 PM. We
got a motel in Monona, the kids played awhile and we then drove along
Lake Monona, by the Capitol, and around the University. Ate supper
and then drove by the Stadium (they have a new addition), went by
Aunt Nellie’s old house (its a dark green color) and on over to
Villas Park. The kids rode the Merry-go-Round, train, and played
awhile. I showed the family where I had gone in the water ha! and I
remembered how I sailed my boat on the lagoon. I remember meeting Mr.
Hilton there once. It got dark so we saw the zoo before we left and
went back to the motel.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>It
rained most of the night and rained some the next AM as we drove up
to Baraboo (we ate at Howard Johnson’s on the way). We were there
by 10:00 to see the loading of the circus wagons by horses. Its
called the Circus World Museums and is the place where M.J. and Bill
must have been. They had a 1 hr one ring circus at 11:00. We ate
lunch there and saw the rest of the museum and it was raining again
as we started back a little before 3:00. It rained hard most of the
way in Wis, but cleared off as we stopped for supper in Ill. It
started raining again as we reached the O’Hare interchange, and it
rained the rest of the way home. We got home about 8:30. It was the
only bad weather of our 5 trips so far.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Hope
your things went off OK yesterday. The trip to Madison from Park
Forest is about 3½ to 4½ hrs depending on how long you stop. We
could easily go up some Sat and back on Sun sometime if you come up.
Our new address will be 454 Tomahawk, but continue to write here
until we let you know. The Circus Museum is about 12 miles from
Dells. I guess we went there once when we were in Wis. Hope you’re
all OK. I had my watch cleaned and repaired. It looks like new. Its
17 yrs old now, I guess, and keeps good time.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Tues PM –</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
The last few days have been warmer, but I doubt if we’ll have much
more real hot weather. Its been dry all summer in Illinois, I guess,
and especially so in the Southern part. It hasn’t rained here since
we went to Wisconsin.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
have a new fellow who wants in our carpool, he lives a couple of
blocks from over near where we’re moving, so I guess we’ll take
him in. That will make five again, each person driving one day a
week. It looks like we’ll be moving about the 15-16</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>.
We’ll have closing the end of this week or sometime next week, I
guess.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
kids say they are not ready for school, but I imagine they will be
glad to get back. Alan starts kindergarten a week from Thurs. The
kindergarten is not public since we’ll be in Will County, the first
county South of Cook. We pay a monthly fee for his kindergarten.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
week one evening Ruth took the 3 older kids to a movie. I stayed with
Andy and he sure wanted to go but he was tired and asleep before they
got home so it was best he didn’t go. Ruth has “held up” real
well in our rental house with all the inconveniences of things not
unpacked, etc.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Everything
at work is fine. I spent most of last week, including time in the
evenings, writing my first big Progress Report. As of now I am
positive that I made the right move in changing jobs. The new job,
new drugs, etc., has been an inspiration and I’ve already learned
considerable.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Sat
AM Ruth finally had time to do a big grocery shopping. In the evening
we had a babysitter and then we went to a s.s. class steak fry in the
backyard of the assistant ministers house. He’s written for our
church letters, I believe. Sun AM was regular s.s. and church. We
were home the rest of the day and it was warm enough that the kids
got in swimming pool. I cleaned the car. Alan went for his pre-school
physical exam yesterday and had several “shots.” He was tired
from them today. Hope you’re all feeling OK. We were glad to have
Mother’s letter last week and to hear all the news. I guess thats
about it.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Wed PM – </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
were glad to have your letter yesterday. Those certainly were
tragedies with the boy and the Dr; I assume the boy was a trumpet or
cornet player. I suppose the Dr could have permanent damage. Ruth is
sewing right now, and has just about finished a school shirt for
Alan. She finished new school dresses for each of the girls. She
finished that sweater for Mrs. Moyes.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
package for Lisa came today. She also received a package from
Oberlin. The Laidigs are back in Oberlin from their trip North for
the highway business that Mr. L does. They may come East for the
Covered Bridge Festival at that small town in Indiana. We went last
year. They plan to come on up here. I’ll let you know, as soon as
possible, what time the’re coming so you, if you want to, can come
at another time.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tomorrow
I have to go downtown to First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association
(1 S Dearborn – North of the Dearborn Station, I guess) for the
“closing” on our house. Ruth fortunately doesn’t have to go. In
the morning I have to get a certified check for the costs that I
haven’t already paid. I’ll then go down on the train; closing is
at 12:30 and I’ll come back afterwards. I’m taking off work, of
course. The other people won’t be there but will be represented by
their lawyer, I guess.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Mrs.
Bredenberg (the one we’re buying from) invited Ruth to a coffee
this Friday to meet some of the neighbors. We think she has felt
sorry for us in this crowded house. They said she was more anxious to
get out of their house in July than he was. I think I mentioned that
the realtor is not charging us any rent here this month, and he will
pay our moving expenses over to the other house.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
is going out to the first circle meeting this evening. We assume
we’ll try to sing in the church choir, but we don’t know whether
rehersal starts tomorrow night or not. I have to buy a bicycle for
Lisa’s birthday since we promised her, like we did for Lesle, one
on her 7</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
birthday. We stayed home most of the Labor Day Weekend. I did a lot
of general reading. I’ve tried to do quite a bit of reading while
we’re here since I didn’t have so much to do here. I haven’t
reviewed many areas of pharmacology in several years. Everything at
work is fine. We have most of our new equipment and are now running
regular expts.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Labor
Day we ate a picnic lunch in the Forest Preserve near here, and then
took an hour and a half hike back into the woods. I guess it was the
longest hike like that we had ever taken. I had to carry Andy most of
the way back. Ruth has been going once a week to the allergist and is
getting some better with her desensitization shots. She goes in the
morning before I leave and then after leaving me she takes Alan for
his kindergarten enrollment. The girls each have 26 students in their
classes which is less than they had in Decatur. Five of your six
grandchildren are now in school. We don’t have a lunch program here
so the girls have to eat at home. We hope Alan gets in an afternoon
kindergarten. Glad to hear you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Tues PM –</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
I’ll try to get this off a day earlier than last week. The mail
isn’t picked up at night at the local post office so I may not take
it down to mail. Today is warmer and cloudy, with a slight chance of
rain. There has been a lot of air pollution and smog over Chicago; we
get some out here but its not too bad. Ruth notices it more than I do
because of her allergies, etc. She is better, and will have to go
only once a month for her desensitization shots – that will save
money, of course.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
plan to move next Monday. It will be a local man for the heavy stuff
and we’ll carry some of the smaller things in the car. We had
originally planned to go to Decatur that weekend, but will delay it
until the next weekend, I guess. The other people are moving on Sat,
so we can’t take anything over until Sun. I suppose I will have to
take Mon off from work. We are very anxious to get moved. The kids
are getting quite restless here and are disobeying quite often. Just
before I got home tonight they had all run off with a couple of the
neighbor kids to see some road construction; they had not asked and
would not have been allowed to go there anyway.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
kids like school OK, I guess. Today was a hard day for Ruth since it
was my day to drive. It takes 30-40 minutes to walk from here over to
the other school. The neighbor lady took the girls. Alan visited the
neighbor boys over where we’re moving and then went to school from
there.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
were glad to have your letter yesterday. That Kenneth Glaze who was
killed in Vietnam was in school about the time I was, I believe, or
else I knew one of his brothers. I remember Olive Glaze, my third
grade teacher I believe. That was too bad about Dr. Orthwein. I
believe Dennis Smith was a year behind me in school and he played the
cornet.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
enjoyed her circle meeting last Wed night. My trip and our other
errands on Thurs went OK. I went down on the train OK. I rode back
with the Realtors lawyer who lives in Park Forest. In the evening I
went to choir practice and then bought Lisa’s birthday bicycle (she
can’t ride it very well) on the way home. A few mins after I left
Andy rolled off the piano bench and cut his lip. Ruth got the
neighbor man to take them to the Dr. to see if he needed a stitch.
Since Andy can’t use a straw he didn’t give him any stitches </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>(?)</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>.
It wasn’t much of a cut. I’m surprised they haven’t hurt
themselves any more than that, considering how rough the’ve been
recently. It was the first night I’d gone anywhere alone except for
shopping.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
has refinished our dresser, and that chest we had in the living room,
in an antique green. They will both go in our bedroom. We stayed
around home most of Sat. Fri night was Lisa’s birthday dinner. Sun
after church (we both sang in the choir) we had the Duvalls down (we
visited them one Sun). One of their children had a birthday that day
so we had another birthday cake.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
is out shopping this evening. Ruth was pleased with the coffee the
lady (Mrs. Bredenberg) gave for her over in the new neighborhood.
They were very friendly. Hope you’re all feeling OK. That was a
nice visit with Bertha Tucker. There is a National Life and Accident
Ins office nearby. The dress was fine. Will be shortened.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Tues PM -</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
I have to go down after a bit and get some flexible pipe to vent the
dryer to the outside. We never bothered to vent it in Decatur since
it was in the basement. Because we didn’t we got a lot of lint in
the basement. The washer and dryer are in the utility room here
behind the kitchen, and the dryer has to be vented, since it lets too
much moisture and lint into the house. I hooked up the washer last
night.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tomorrow
night we visit the session at church prior to joining on Sun. Thurs
night is choir practice. The kids all like school OK, I guess? The
girls went for their first piano lessons today. They are taking them
from a lady </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>(Mrs.
Aageson) </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>over

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Alan
has the most friends he has ever had in the neighborhood here. The
days are getting cooler and it got into the 30’s yesterday morning.
I may not have mentioned that the two added on bedrooms have a
separate furnace. The kitchen wallpaper that I put up (I had done
about 2/3) started to peel off since I had not sized or sanded the
underlying plasticized wallpaper. Ruth took it all off now we’ll
have to put it up with regular paste. It was the pre-pasted kind that
you dip in water.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Work
is OK – I’m plenty busy. Sat morning we drove to Decatur and got
a motel room at a motel near where we lived. In the afternoon we
visited the old neighbors. I saw one of the Neisler fellows and
called another. Things are still in a state of uncertainty and I’m
glad I left when I did. We saw our old house and the man and his wife
have built a new garage and enclosed the old garage ready to make a
new dining room. He is a real worker and does most of it himself
working late at night. He makes his labor money when he sells the
house.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Sun
we went to the old church and sang in the choir (46 there including
students). It is, of course, a much better choir than the one here.
We had dinner at the Hofflands and stopped to see some other people
before we came back. Got here about 8:30. We were glad we went. The
Laidigs will probably be here about Oct 8-15. Why don’t you come
right after that. Tell all hello.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Wed PM -</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
Ruth should be home anytime from the first PTA meeting of the year. I
suppose I’ll go once in a while. I think I only went one time in
Decatur, so I suppose I should go more often now that we have three
children in school.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
had distressing news today when we heard that Rev Moyes’s now has
cancer of the liver. He’s the one in Kansas City that we saw last
summer. He had surgery for cancer several months ago and I guess it
had already spread. I’m glad we got to see them last summer. Ruth
knitted a sweater for Mrs. Moyes recently and she sent the thank you
note with the news.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The

They could come one day later that week. I would leave work a little
early and we could pick you up at the station. If the train arrives
at 3:15 you would have to wait awhile until we got there. Another
possibility would be to come on the 21</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>st</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
and we would pick you up the same way or, if you want to go to
Madison, we could pick you up at the station and go on to Madison Fri
night and come back Sat morning. If you wanted to stay longer in
Madison you could come back on the train and we’d pick you up at
the station.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We’re
gradually getting settled although we still have redecorating to do.
Ruth has really worked hard but she likes to redecorate a house. Last
Sat and Sun we worked around the house and I made good headway on
cleaning up the stuff that had piled up in the carport. Sun AM we
were welcomed into church. This Sun there will be a reception for the
new members. Tomorrow night is choir practice. We like the house fine
and I think it will give us the room we need. We like the king size
bed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
to have your letter. Hope everyone is feeling OK. The nights are
getting colder here. I’m “snowed under” at work. I’m involved
in more projects than I was at Neisler. The paper stuck the 2</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>nd</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
time in the kitchen and we papered (vinyl wallpaper) 2 walls of the
girls’ bedroom Sun night. I’ll have to put up our storm windows.
I could meet someone at the airport. It is quite a bit farther, of
course. I bought new casual shoes Mon PM. They feel OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

of 10-9-66</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
– Dear Mother and All, Thanks for your letter. Your schedule sounds
fine. Unless something comes up I will meet you at the Dearborn
Station as soon as I can get down there. Just wait on one of the
benches and I’ll see you its not such a big station. Ruth is
scheduled to teach s.s. class that Sun so I will go alone and take
you to Madison. She can easily get a ride to church. We were all in
Madison last summer you know, so the kids won’t miss anything. I
think this plan is the best and it avoids the bother with the kids in
the car. The Laidigs made it OK and everything else is fine.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Dear Aunt Clara, Mother, M.J. &amp; Bill, I’ll write on some of
this old Neisler stationery. It is much colder here today and will
get down into the 20’s or lower tonight, which will make it our
coldest night. As you may have heard on the news we had quite a bit
of snow yesterday. It was snowing quite hard when we got up in the
AM, and snowed most of the way to work. Near the lab and for a few
miles to the North it didn’t snow much.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
went to the allergist today and he gave her some antibiotic for an
infected spot on her leg which started with an insect bite. The kids
were pleased with their cards, Mother. Glad you had a nice companion
on the train. I thought she might be someone like you described when
I saw her on the train. We were certainly glad you could come. I got
home OK. I got the low living room curtain up on the front window Sat
PM while I listened to the football game. Ruth did some shopping Sat
PM.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><A NAME="_GoBack"></A><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>My
boss leaves for Japan in the AM. I’ll go to Pittsburgh on the 15th.
Dr. Bastian, my boss, is stopping in Hawaii on the way back. Last Sun
PM we had the callers from the church for the pledges and then Ruth
and I went to the Messiah rehersal – they had a big crowd. The
rehersals are at the Bloom High School which is the main high school
in Chicago Heights where our church is. We go for choir practice
tonight at someones home since we don’t have to sing Sun.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
were at home Mon and Tues nights. Ruth went to circle meeting last
night since PTA open house was called off because of the snow. The
kids did not have to go to school yesterday because of the snow.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Hope
you’re all OK. I’m glad you didn’t try to come, Aunt Clara,
since it would have been hard on the train. Even though it was windy,
the weather was the best one could have asked for, especially
considering the change in weather this week. If the weather had been
like yesterday we probably wouldn’t have wanted to drive to
Madison. As I told Mother, one can park right by the Dearborn
Station, so it makes only a short walk from the station. However,
like that Sat AM, it often quite a distance walking down to the right
coach on the train. It looked like the pullmans and compartments were
nearer the main part of the station.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
kids were thrilled with trick or treat Mon night. Your letter came
after Mother left since it had, by mistake, been sent to the address
of the people who used to live here. Sorry you couldn’t come but
maybe someone can drive you up sometime when its warm.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Mon 5:00 PM -</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
I just arrived at O’Hare so will write this while I’m waiting.
This was my day to drive but I had traded off. I got a rental car at
Kankakee and then drove it by home. I stayed there while Ruth took
the girls to their music lessons, and left for here after she got
back. I beat the traffic rush. The plane for Pittsburgh leaves at
6:45. I’ll be at the Hilton Hotel tonight and then see the fellows
tomorrow and come back tomorrow night. Going back to Park Forest I’ll
get another rented car. It will be quite late tomorrow night when I
get back home. I’m going to visit a couple of pharmacologists at
the University of Pittsburgh, School of Pharmacy (like Dr. Wenzel at
Kansas). They have done some work with some of our drugs.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
weather is warmer today and is supposed to be nice tomorrow, also. I
guess the girls are getting along fine with their music lessons,
although it is sometimes hard to get them to practice. They are
switching their lessons from Tues to Mon so I’ll have to switch my
driving day from Mon to Tues. Everything at work is fine. Dr. Bastian
is still in Japan. I may have mentioned that he went to Japan to find
out about some drug testing that Armour is having done over there. He
is planning to stop in Hawaii (sp?) on the way back.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Yesterday
we all went to church as usual. The adult choir sang and did OK but
Ruth was one of only four altos. Choir practice a week ago last Thurs
night was at someones house since the adult choir didn’t have to
sing at the service a week ago Sun. The kids all had colds so they
all stayed home with Ruth and I was the only one to go to church.
There was a big crowd since the youth choir sang.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Yesterday
afternoon Ruth and I both went to Messiah rehersal (Ruth missed the
second rehersal a week ago yesterday) at the High School over in
Chicago Heights. This is a community chorus (like the one in
Hutchinson) which sings every year at Christmas (they do not always
sing the Messiah) with orchestra accompaniment. They have one of
their biggest choirs this year and it has been fun singing. I think I
sang the Messiah once in Hutchinson when it was out at the Sports
Arena, and then I played the cornet once when it was at Convention
Hall.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>My
job over the weekend was to put together the shutter panels for the
kitchen window. The matching fabric finally came in (it was quite
late) so Ruth was quite anxious to get them started. She put the
undercoat on them today and will probably finish painting them
tomorrow. The fabric inserts don’t take long to make. I put the
girls shutters up last week and they look real nice. Ruth finished
antiqueing those bookcases (I cut them in sections), so we have some
more book storage space. Glad to have your letter last week and we
hope everyone is OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

– I better write this tonight since we have Messiah rehersal
tomorrow night and regular choir practice on Thurs night. There is
another rehersal Sat night, and the performance is next Sun
afternoon. We have both enjoyed singing in it. It will be with the
orchestra like the one in Hutch used to be. Our church choir sang at
the Union Thanksgiving Service at the church (all my pens are lousy)
</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>(This
is written in pale pink barely readable ink. Argh!) </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>on
Thanksgiving AM, as I may have said over the phone. They didn’t
have a nursery so the kids sat in the balcony with that friend of
Ruth’s who was visiting us. Afterwards we all came back home so
Ruth could finish making the desserts for our dinner. We drove to the
Duvalls in Addison (NW of Franklin Park) and had our dinner about the
middle of the afternoon. Mr. Duvall (Jack) is my age and Carol is 2
yrs older than Ruth. Jack and I watched the football and we drove
back after dark. It was raining then.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
was off work Fri and didn’t do much. Ruth and Shirley went downtown
awhile. We stayed home Fri night. Sat was about as usual and in the
evening we took Shirley back downtown to the bus station in the loop.
The Christmas decorations on State Street are very pretty. It rained
that evening and there was one seat left on the bus for Shirley.
Shirley (Mrs. McNulty) is a year older than Ruth and is a graduate
student at the University of Wisconsin working on a Masters in
Spanish. She and Ruth were classmates up through high school and she
started to KU at the same time as Ruth but had to stop because of
arthritus. She has had a hard life. She married an older man who died
3 yrs ago and did not leave her anything. They had a good marriage
and he helped her get her college (in Denver). She has been sick some
since and has taught, and was one of a select few to be chosen for
this special group, all getting their Masters together. She has a
boyfriend in Denver. The last time Ruth saw her was at our wedding.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Carol
Duvall (where we ate on Thanksgiving) was in Ruth and Shirleys class
in grade school but she moved away. The 3 women had a good time
visiting. Sun schedule was as usual with Messiah rehersal in the
afternoon. Hope you’re all OK. Kids are OK but noisy. The weather
is colder here. I drove today but no more snow yet. Everything at
work is OK. Dr. Bastien got back from Japan. We’re working on the
front bathroom shutters. I got the acoustical tile up around the
washer and dryer.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Tues 7:00 PM -</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
I have a better pen than last, so I will try to write more legibly.
Yesterday and today have been warmer, but it has been rainy and
foggy. Today was my day to drive, but the fog wasn’t as bad as
yesterday, both morning and evening. We all leave a little earlier on
the bad weather days and I believe we have only been late once. I
still get home from work earlier than most of the men in the block,
and I don’t have to leave any earlier in the morning.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
can’t seem to locate M.J. and Bill’s address so would you please
pass the enclosed letter on to them. It was a real coincidence when
the Investor’s man called and after we had talked awhile, to find
out that he knew both M.J. and Bill at K-State.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Wed night was the Messiah rehersal with the orchestra. Thurs night
was regular church choir practice. Ruth did not go there since our
regular babysitter could not come. Sat afternoon the 3 older kids
went to a play (Community Children’s Theater) at the school and I
stayed with Andy while Ruth went shopping. Sat evening was the full
Messiah dress rehersal with the soloists and orchestra.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Sun
morning was church as usual. The Messiah performance went fine in the
afternoon. I’ll enclose the clippings and the program. It was rainy
and cold but they had a good crowd. It was held in the Bloom High
School, which is the main high school in Chicago Heights (East of
here – went through there on way over to the highway going
downtown). I believe Ruth and I both enjoyed singing in the big
chorus. We have been eating out on Sun evenings after Messiah
rehersal but the weather was so bad that we stayed home Sun night.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
were home last night. Tomorrow night Ruth has circle and there is an
open house at school at the same time. I haven’t thought much about
Christmas but Ruth has already been working hard. Ruth and I are
social chairmen for our s.s. class so she has been working hard on
the Christmas program at church which we are in charge of (our
class). Andy slept with us last night because of a cold but I believe
he’s better today. Ruth and Lesle have colds, also. Everything else
is about the same. Hope you’re all OK and everything is fine. That
was a nice trip you had to Jetmore. You were lucky to get both trips
in this fall.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Thurs PM -</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
I waited to write your letter so I could include it in your regular
card. Also, Aunt Clara’s card was mailed earlier with a note so you
have probably seen it by now. Today was perfect weather for this time
of the year and the last few days have been nice after our dark
dreary spell. Ruth got the cards off early this year because we had
moved and getting our cards first would enable people to change our
address. Our mail is being forwarded OK from Decatur, however.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
has been working hard on making some presents, decorations, and, of
course, buying many presents. I guess we’re on as good a Christmas
schedule as last year when things were late because Ruth was knitting
so many presents. Ruth bought a silk-screen outfit shortly after last
Christmas and used it this year for the cards. It saved a lot of time
in making the cards; she loves to be creative and make our cards. She
just finished making a nice pair of red slippers for Deloris.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
guess we had a letter from the Laidigs not too long ago. They are
busy this month because they have accepted offices in Eastern Star
and I believe they take office this month. They had been active years
ago but had been inactive while the kids were growing up. Lisa went
to Brownies after school today. As you may recall, Lesle did not want
to join. Lisa enjoys it. The girls both have more interest in their
piano than I anticipated, and have already gone far beyond what I
ever did ha!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I’ve
had some hoarseness for about a week. Fortunately it didn’t start
it after the Messiah was over or I wouldn’t have been able to sing.
I didn’t have any voice last Thurs night at choir practice but it
got better and I was helpful on last Sun’s anthem. It was worse
yesterday, but better today. Tonight is choir practice again. I’ll
need my voice Sun afternoon since I’m supposed to do a few tricks
at that all-church Christmas party. As I think I told you, our s.s.
class is in charge of it and Ruth has coordinated it since we’re
the social chairmen.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
has had a kidney infection the last week, but it has cleared up
pretty well on a sulfa drug. The kids haven’t missed any school but
have traces of cold, I guess. Mon night we all went out and bought
the tree. Tues night we all went to the library, and went shopping
awhile. Later in the evening I put the tree up. Its in the family
room by the doors.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
night Ruth went out to eat at a circle meeting. I ate pizza with the
kids and they decorated the tree after I had put the lights on. The
kids strung popcorn and cranberries. Last weekend I spent most of my
time sorting and storing all my magazines, books, clippings, etc.
Found a few of your clippings. Ruth did the cards last weekend, and
since she writes notes on all the out of town cards, it takes quite a
while.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Haven’t
received your letter this week but I’ll mail this anyway. Best
wishes to all for the Holiday Season.</FONT></FONT></P>

longer. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>(5

had hoped to get it off Thurs evening but I didn’t get it done. We
got the “tail-end” of the snowstorm that hit Kansas and the
Mid-West, but it wasn’t too bad. About 4 inches, I guess, and some
wind, but not as bad as the weather report sounded. We were late to
work that morning, but haven’t had any trouble since. I drove on
Tues, which was the day before the snow. It has been cold since.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
are taking it easy this AM, since it was late when we got home last
night. Yesterday was a regular working day, and we had Alan’s
birthday dinner (hot dogs) after I got home. He had a birthday party
with some of the neighborhood boys before I got home. Ruth had a busy
day since she had to pick up some presents and get ready for the
party. Your package came and the boys will open it tonight. Thanks.
They say “Thanks” for the dollar bills. Alan got some GI Joe
(soldier doll) accessories and a cowboy outfit (everything except
boots). Some of the cowboy things were from the Laidigs. They left
most of their Christmas packages when they were here in the fall.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>After
Alans supper the Bastians picked us up to go back to Kankakee; we
attended a party at the Dr. Joe Dailey’s house. He is Director of
Research and is over the Departments of Pharmacology (Jim Bastian),
Biochemistry, Pathology, and Organic Chemistry. He is nice but is
somewhat on the spot if research doesn’t produce. It was easier
going with the Bastians since they knew the way, and we didn’t.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tonight,
of course, is Andy’s birthday dinner and presents. There is a
neighborhood party but I’m not sure that we are going. Ruth had
trouble getting a baby sitter for last night. The invitation was so
late that most of the baby sitters were already engaged. We got a boy
from next door (the Philips) who was younger, but we thought it was
OK since he was just a few feet from his home. I’m off work Mon, of
course, and tomorrow will be regular services at church. The choir
doesn’t sing tomorrow.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>That
Christmas Party at the church on the afternoon of the 18</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
went fine. Ruth organized much of it. My magic show (15 mins) went
fine. The kids moved right up in front of me on the floor so I didn’t
have much room, but I fooled them and they enjoyed it. That was the
first show I had given since last Jan at a church group in Decatur.
The girls did not have music lessons during the vacation, and I think
Ruth will be glad to have the kids back in school.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Our
regular Christmas Eve service was on Fri night. We sang in the choir
and the kids sat in the balcony, but were quite wiggly. Sat night we
went to the Christmas Eve Service at the nearby United Protestant
Church where our neighbors attend. It was a candlelight service so we
joined in and all carried our lighted candles on the way out. I’ll
enclose the program since the prelude was one of William Lesters.
Send to Aunt Margaret if you want sometime. I noticed the name Lester
on the program so I asked the organist after the service and, sure
enough, it was written by Bill in 1924 (copyright), and was in book
of preludes. Our organist at church is an older lady and her husband
is a composer. They both remember the Lesters; I don’t know whether
they knew them personally but they definitely remember the Lesters
and their work in church music circles in the Chicago area.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
guess I told you over the phone what we did on Christmas Day. On Mon,
which I had off, we cleaned and straightened the boys room and
started to paint it yellow. Ruth finished it on Tues. My job is to
get the wall brackets and shelves up so some of the toys can be put
away. Ruth ordered two unfinished chests, which haven’t arrived
yet, for the boys to put their clothes in. The chest I made with the
tote drawers will be used entirely for toys.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Wed
night we all went over to Mr. and Mrs. Ed Wille’s house in Chicago
Heights. He is an older retired man who sings bass in the choir; he
is a lot of fun and he has an electric train set-up in his basement
which he thought the children would enjoy seeing. They did and we
enjoyed visiting with some friends of theirs who were visiting. We
were glad you all enjoyed the presents. We thought the photographer
was good in getting all 6 with good expressions. Andy looks like the
youngest son of John Laidigs at about the same age.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
all say “Thank You” to everyone for the presents. As I told Aunt
Clara we used her money for the crèche (nativity scene) which Ruth
liked at Marshall Fields (they have a store in Park Forest). She had
been looking for years for the type she wanted.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Your
money will go on a lamp for the living room after we rearrange things
after the holiday season. I wore your red tie last night and M.J. &amp;
Bill’s tie tack. I needed the tie tack since one of my best ones
had just broken. I received some shirts, pants, gloves (my new ones a
year ago were stolen at church), etc. and a wooden mortar and pestle.
From the family Ruth received a copper kitchen battery clock which is
over the sink, a popcorn popper, an electric can opener and knife
sharpener, long good gloves and a big jewel cabinet to set on the
chest in the bedroom.</FONT></FONT></P>

with mixes where they add water. The girls are writing thank you
notes right now. Alan got GI Joe, an easy show projector which shows
a real film. They all like the games and cars you sent. The girls
have played the games and they seemed familiar to me. The little cars
and trucks were all very familiar to me. Thanks again for everything.
Andy got the usual wooden trains, clock etc. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Mom

yesterday, “But, Mommy, it’s my birthday, too!” He finally
accepted the fact that his wasn’t till today. The girls made him a
cake this morning – about 5” diameter. Carroll seems to have told
you most everything. Oh yes, the girls got Francie dolls which they
