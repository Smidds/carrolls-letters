weeks slip by… Andy arrives early, but slowly. He is pronounced
“perfect,” but gradually becomes “more and more like the other
kids,” and even refuses to look Dad in the eye. Dad forgives him.

the meetings. Lesle likes the Beatles. Lisa gets labeled. Alan runs
through glass. Andy’s naps are too short. The kids are thrilled
again and again. There are repairs and replacements and regular
activities. And, as usual, nobody ever seems to know quite where the

Dear Mother, Hope you’re feeling better by now. When I called about
Andy the nurse said you were doing better. Your blood pressure
reading sounds real good – probably better than man. Everybody has
been real helpful recently and we are making it OK. I have Mrs.
Graber in yesterday and today so I could come to work. Ruth probably
won’t come home before Monday. It’s a lot warmer her today. Got
all the Christmas things OK and everyone say “Thanks.” I still
haven’t taken the tree down. I’ll write details later. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>All

– Sun afternoon - </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Dear
Mother and Aunt Clara, I’m at the hospital now. The visiting hours
are 2-4 &amp; 7-8. I’ve been able to get here for most of the
periods with babysitters and others helping out. Ruth will go home
tomorrow. She probably could have gone home today but it would have
been more difficult since I took the kids to church this morning and
sang in the choir. I got Laura Brenneman this afternoon. She is the
high school girl who regularly sits on Wed night while we go to choir
practice. I don’t know whether I’ll go to choir practice this Wed
or not. I guess we’ll have to take turns on Sun morning for awhile
until Andy is old enough to go out. He seems to be doing fine, but
being a little early isn’t quite as active as the others were, and
doesn’t always want to eat when Ruth wants him to. Ruth is feeding
him, of course, like she did with Alan. I guess the kids are prepared
to have a new baby brother at home but it will be interesting to see
how they react. Kay Hoffland said she might come in tomorrow to clean
etc. before Ruth gets home.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
to have your cards. Sorry I didn’t get more written but the last
week has been somewhat hectic, of course. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Somewhat?
</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Sun morning we all went to church and s.s. as usual. We sang in the
choir. The car was running then. In the afternoon I watched the
football game and then we all went to the Jensens for coffee and
something to eat. They live about a couple of blocks and are
Presbyterians. They have 4 children and are scandinavians like the
Hofflands.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Mon
morning I went to work and the car started, by noon however it
wouldn’t go, so I had to get a push. I had had a new set of spark
plugs put in and it had been going since the first time it gave out.
I couldn’t get it in the Ford place that afternoon but he said I
probably could on Tues. I needed the car because Ruth had a checkup
that afternoon. With a push, however, I got it started and kept it
running the rest of the afternoon enough to get Ruth down to see the
Dr. and then downtown for some shopping, and to pick up an Etch a
Sketch for Alan’s birthday that day. The Dr. had said it wouldn’t
be long, but I thought she would go a day or so. We got back home and
had Alan’s birthday cake, after having stopped for hot dogs at
Woolworths (Alan said he wanted hotdogs for his birthday dinner –
ha!). He had his presents and we all opened the presents from you,
also. Thanks again for everything. Ruth felt better later in the
evening and did some ironing. I was tired and went on to bed. The Dr.
had said to go on to the hospital at the first sign of anything so
she woke me up about midnight and said we had better go on down. Mrs.
Lewis from across the street came over and slept on the couch while
we went down.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Fortunately
the car started. It didn’t make much difference, however, as there
was no great hurry. Ruth got some sleep that night and I dozed a
little bit while waiting here. About 4:00 AM I drove the car for
about 30 minutes to warm it up. Since she didn’t seem to be going
very fast I went on home about 6:30 and let Mrs. Lewis go on home.
That morning Cindy (she wasn’t in school) came over and stayed
while I went to work. The car started that morning but wouldn’t
start that noon so I got a ride home with the fellows. I left the car
at the lab. I had called that morning and they couldn’t fix the car
after all. Les Chafity (the fellow at the lab who is leaving) let me
borrow his car, so Tues afternoon I went out and made an appointment
for the car on Thurs, went downtown (took the mirror back ordered
another just like it) for some things and visited Ruth, she was still
in the labor room. That afternoon I had left the kids at the
Jensen’s. In the evening I was able (new years eve) to get Cindy
again so I came back here. Andy got here about 9:00 and I was home by
10:30. (We were off work Tues afternoon and Wed.)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Wed
noon we were invited over to the Dave Stuart’s (fellow at lab) for
dinner and then we watched the football games and I came on down to
see Ruth while the kids stayed there. I still had the borrowed car
but left it with the fellow that evening. Thurs and Fri I went to
work as usual and had Mrs. Graber (the older lady who babysits) come
in. She charged $5 a day. I got the car in Thurs and they fixed the
automatic choke which wasn’t working, so it should start now in the
0 weather. I’ve spent $70 on the car the last two times it’s been
in. Thurs night I came back to see Ruth as I did on Fri. I had Laura
Thurs night, and Friday night Kay brought in some food and then came
back while I came here. Sat morning I took down the Christmas tree
and in the afternoon Cindy came over while I came down here.
Yesterday evening we ate supper at the Van Altin’s (friends that
live north of us) and they kept the kids while I came down here.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>As
you see, everyone has been real kind and even though it has been a
hectic week it all worked out real well. Ruth got to be at home for
Alan’s birthday and the baby arrived in time to be a tax exemption
for 1963 – so we have no complaints ha! Ruth feels OK – she has
some numbness again in a leg like she did after Alan. She may need it
checked if it doesn’t go away in time. Glad to hear that you were
getting to go home from the hospital and hope everything’s OK by
now. Mrs. L is not coming now so I might have to take off from work
some next week if Ruth is too tired. I imagine the grandparents will
want to come see the new grandson before too long.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Tues AM -</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
Everyone is fine here and hope you’re all OK. As you heard we had
quite a blizzard here Sun. Things are pretty much back to normal
today. Andy is doing fine. He doesn’t sleep as much as he did at
first, and he’s awake more at night. Ruth is getting along OK. I
stayed home part of the time last week. They came home a week ago
yesterday morning. We may hear from you today. They didn’t deliver
mail yesterday.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Thurs PM – </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
were glad to have your recent letter and all the cards, etc. Glad
you’re feeling better. We’ve been pretty free of colds recently.
I still have a touch of hoarseness when I sing. There has been a lot
of laryngititis here this winter. You probably heard about the
blizzard here in central Illinois; I guess other places had it pretty
bad also. It started snowing and blowing last Sat night; by Sun
morning it had accumulated and was a real blizzard. It continued most
of the day. Since the Dr. had said Ruth could go to church if she
felt like it she was planning to go. However, we all stayed home. I
said she could go after I put the chains on the car but she didn’t
want to go without the kids – they couldn’t possibly have walked
against the wind and snow. I put the chains on the car in the
afternoon but didn’t try to go anywhere. Since we were at home I
worked in the basement and, except for some sorting of magic and
magazines, have got it in pretty good shape again. We have been
letting the cat in the basement these cold days and nights so he
makes some messes that I have to clean up.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Mon
morning I stayed home from work as they hadn’t plowed the parking
lot yet when I went by about 9:00 (after shoveling quite a bit here
to get the car out). A lot of the fellows were late getting to work
that day. I shoveled some more Mon and Tues nights. There wasn’t so
much snow (about 8 inches) but the drifts were very bad. Last night
we had our regular babysitter, Laura, and we went to choir practice.
Except for an 1½ hr shopping last week it was the first time Ruth
had been out since coming home. Tonight Ruth went over to the PTA
meeting. It was the first time she had been this year. She is feeling
pretty good, better than with the others, I guess, but still has some
numbness and now has some sinus headache or something. Sat night we
will eat out with some of the Neisler people honoring that chemist
Lester Chafity who is leaving.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
and Andy came home a week ago Mon morning. A week ago last night I
went to a party after choir practice honoring a lady choir member who
is leaving town. I stayed home from work about a 1/3 of the time last
week to help Ruth. I’ve gone full time this week, so we seem to be
making it in good shape. Mrs. L wrote that she just didn’t feel up
to coming as she did with the others. Andy is being awake more now
and crying more, he is hard to burp, but Ruth still calls him a
perfect baby. When he first came home he just ate and slept and
hardly cried at all. He eats at least once in the night but at least
we don’t have to warm bottles. The babysitter gave him some formula
last night for the first time (he had water in the hospital) and she
said he didn’t fuss at all and was “perfect.” I’m glad he got
here before the storm as we would have been nervous.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I’m
buying Ruth an oval rug for the bedroom. She was always going to put
3 small rugs (braided) together for a big one but I don’t think
she’ll have time. The insurance at work paid over 2/3 of the
hospital bill so that will help. It was less at the hospital here
than in Chicago. Everything at work is OK. I worked on a report
during the hectic 2 wks. Again, glad you’re feeling better. I guess
I never did write all the Christmas details. The kids enjoyed the Dr.
and nurse kits and didn’t get any big stuff. You may keep the
picture of Andy (taken at the hospital with his face irritated) and
the other things sent under separate cover. Ruth dyed the baby basket
liner (it was pink – you and M.J. made it, I guess) a light green
so it looks fresh. I put the cradle back together and Andy sleeps in
it some during the day. Andy probably won’t go out for a while yet.</FONT></FONT></P>

We’ve had a relaxing Sunday so I’ll write this now and take it
down to mail later, along with some more birth announcements. I think
Aunt Clara’s has been sent but Ruth hadn’t gotten down to yours
yet. She is making them and it takes a little while; I think she has
done a good job. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Do
any of these survive? </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Andy
is doing fine (yes, its the one l in Philip) but has a little
wheeziness now. Ruth apparently has a cold now and she doesn’t get
one very often. Andy definitely has the Laidig forehead, like Alan
has, but he may have more of my mouth and chin, time will tell; he
certainly has the back of my head.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Too
bad about Mr. Kilmer. I expect he’s in his 60’s now, isn’t he?
Glad you’re gradually getting back to normal. I took the kids to
s.s. this morning. Ruth stayed home with Andy. Maybe next Sun Ruth
can get out and I’ll stay home. We would both have gone this
morning if we could have gotten a neighbor girl to come. We’ve been
in this afternoon and the kids are now watching “The Wizard of Oz”
on TV – I think it’s about the 4</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
time that Lesle has seen it. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>And
we would continue to watch it annually for many years to come </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Wingdings, serif"><FONT SIZE=2></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>This
Tues night I have the Neisler Credit Union meeting to attend. I have
a loan with them and if we think we can afford a new car by next
summer we’ll probably borrow the money from them. The Laidigs write
that they may go back to the New York worlds fair this summer so they
will probably stop by here on the way back. The Eldon Laidigs (the
brother who is my age and who is a principal in Arvada, Colo –
Denver suburb) have never visited us since we’ve been married; he
may go to a Coast Guard school in Virginia this summer to teach, so
they may finally go through here and visit us, we hope. They have one
son, Larry.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Everything
at work is about the same. My salary raise for this year was $440.
This has been some discontent with salaries here but that’s pretty
normal wherever you may be. While our salaries may be slightly below
some of those elsewhere there are advantages here. I’ve had little
or no pressure put on me for results and that makes for an easier
job.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>With
the help of Andy I should get $300 back on my income tax. We still
have some things we want to get to fix up the upstairs like we want
it. For Ruth’s birthday I told her to go ahead and order an oval
rug for the bedroom. Last weekend I finished cleaning up the basement
so it’s in the best shape since we’ve been here. The washer is
about to give out, however. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>It’s
always something. </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Sun I took the kids to church. Our preacher is leaving. I guess some
of them didn’t like him and withheld their pledges. Last Tues night
Ruth went to an AAUW meeting and Andy stayed asleep for me all the
time she was gone. Wed night we had our regular sitter and both went
to choir practice. Thurs night I went to Westminster Men’s meetings
at the church. Yesterday morning Ruth took the kids and Lesle got new
red Sunday shoes like Lisa. Later she took Lisa downtown for a
haircut.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Mom
takes over: </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
was going to write my thank you on your announcement, but since I
haven’t gotten the ones for S done, I’ll go ahead now. I used the
money for a large round pin with green stones and a few crystals set
in gold. I’d been wanting a nice pin to wear with my beige silk
dress, but felt it was a luxury I couldn’t afford. Anyway, I shall
enjoy it, and thank you. I haven’t put pictures in the picture
holder yet, since I’m waiting for some of the new ones yet to be
developed. And speaking of pictures, the picture of Andy was taken on
the only day he had a slightly raw face. His face was really
perfectly clear until then and since then, too. Andy seems to be
quite fair, with the usual large dark blue eyes, dark brown hair,
Carroll’s lips and back of head, and my chin shape (from the front,
that is). He has large hands and enormous feet (for a tiny baby) and
it seems as though we can just see him growing every day. Lesle is
about to lose her first tooth – a lower one – and is quite
anxious for it to fall out so she can leave it for the tooth fairy.

usual, I didn’t get this written as soon as I thought I would.
We’re gradually working into a more normal schedule although Andy
is becoming more like his brother and sisters were; in other words,
he is fussy more for longer periods of time and sleeps less and less.
Actually, however, we have no complaints – he has been a good baby.
The Lewis’s from across the street east were just over to listen to
our Fisher stereo radio phonograph – they are thinking of buying
one. I have another envelope of clippings and things and will send it
on soon. We have a roll of film at the drugstore that we haven’t
picked up yet. Everything at work is about the same. I’ve had Pete
as full time help for the last couple of weeks since the instrument
he uses when he isn’t working for me has broken down. We’ve
gotten quite a bit of work done.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Sun (yesterday) morning I stayed home with Andy while Ruth took the
kids to s.s. and she sang in the choir. She had stayed home with Andy
the 2 previous Sundays, so it was the first Sun she had been out
since Andy was born. Andy slept until just before she got back, so I
just gave him some water to hold him off until she got here. We were
home the rest of the day yesterday. Our new bedroom rug came today
and I put it down after supper tonight. Last week we went to choir
practice as usual on Wed night; it was early and then Ruth went to
meeting and I went over to the Miliken U choir concert with a couple
of fellows. Ruth came back for me after her meeting. Glad to have
your letter and to hear that everything is OK. You must plan on
coming to see Andy before long. Mrs. L wrote that Mr. L thinks it’s
about time they came this way. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Mom

We’ll know how big Andy is Wed – he goes for his check-up then.
We think we can see him lengthening out from day to day. He’s quite
strong and is like Lesle in wanting to be upright – he stands quite
a bit, and if he just had the muscular control could actually stand
alone, since he supports his weight (you may remember Lesle started
doing this at about one month). </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Back

Dear Aunt Clara and Mother, I’ll send this letter to you and you
can pass it on to Mother. I’ll enclose some pictures that you can
look at. You and Mother may each keep one of the pictures for
yourselves and have any copies of the others made that you want. You
can return the others when you are through with them. Andy is fussy
now. As we said in the last letter to Hutchinson he is getting more
and more like the other kids were. His eyes give the appearance of
smiling and, like the others, he likes to be held upright. Ruth is
now trying to get the ironing done before she has to take care of
Andy. Ruth stayed home with Andy this morning while I took the kids
to church. We rode with the Hofflands since I couldn’t get the car
started. I have it started this afternoon, however.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>It’s
nice you’ve been able to regularly see Uncle Clyde. The winter
weather will be clearing before long and it will make it easier. We
have choir practice this Wed night and Community Concert on Fri night
(a folk singer). We got the bond OK from Mother and the girls’
mirror came OK. I had forgotten to mention them. We were supposed to
have a church census taken today but no one has come. I may have
mentioned that our preacher resigned recently but will stay through
the spring. We’re having some wet snow now but no accumulation.
We’ve had mild weather recently and no accumulation of snow since
that blizzard about a month ago. Last week we had choir practice Wed
night. Ruth had her check-up Tues afternoon and Andy his first
check-up Wed morning. It was the first time Andy had been out since
he came home from the hospital. Lesle has some cold and Lisa didn’t
feel like eating this noon. It’s been a hard winter for colds and
everything. Had a note yesterday from Mary Janet. She told about her
surprise birthday dinner. Hope you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>2-18-64
– Tues PM – </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
to have the letter from Aunt Clara and yours today and to know that
you’re all doing quite well. We still haven’t had any word from
Andy’s grandparents about their coming to see him. Andy is doing
fine although is still having his normal fussy times. At the Dr.’s
last week he weighed 8 lbs which was a gain of a pound and a half in
the 4 weeks since they came home from the hospital. Andy is going
longer at night and has gone as long as 6-7 hrs; he’s usually up at
least once during the night and sometimes goes to sleep in the bed
with us. We hope to buy a new king size bed sometime later this
spring. Our new rug looks nice in the bedroom.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tomorrow
morning Ruth has a meeting and a new lady will come to stay with the
kids. Tomorrow night we’ll go to choir practice and take
refreshments. The attendance of women in the choir has fallen off
since Christmas. There has been a lot of sickness and one regular
lady has moved away. Our income tax refund came today so we’ll
finally be able to completely pay off the loan we made for a down
payment on the house, along with interest. Although we’ll still owe
on some of the furniture and things we have bought, we’ll certainly
feel relieved to get the down payment taken care of. Maybe we can
swing a better car by summer, or when the ‘65 models come out.
We’ve certainly enjoyed the phonograph.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Everything
at work is fine. That fellow who helped me 2 days a week now is with
me full time. I’m not sure I told you that I’m in a car pool with
Don Heitmeyer, and David Stuart. They used to drive with Les Chafity
– the fellow who moved away - so I took his place. Ruth has an AAUW
meeting Thurs night so she is gradually getting back to old schedule;
she doesn’t like to leave Andy 2 nights in a row, however.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Yes,
I received the 2 books OK, thanks. Last week Lisa and Alan were
finally running fevers so we went to the Dr. and he gave them some
penicillin. They seem OK now. I still have some rawness in my throat
and Ruth still has touches. Maybe we’ll clear up when it gets warm.
Lesle went to a birthday dinner for Tommy Hoffland (her age)
yesterday. I had a new distributer put in the car and it finally
starts a lot better. Actually, we’ve been fortunate with the car.
Only since we’ve been in Decatur and could afford it have things
really begun to wear out. Ruth dyed the couch and the big rocker
chair covers a medium blue and they look a lot better and give a nice
contrast with the red things etc. The original color was looking worn
and quite dirty.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
week I stayed home from choir practice and Ruth went with the
Hofflands. It was snowing and the car wasn’t starting well and the
kids were just getting over their fevers so we didn’t want to have
the babysitter in. Fri night I stayed home while Ruth went to the
community concert with the Heitmeyers (the chemist at work I ride
with). They stopped for coffee and to see Andy afterward. We stayed
in Sat and it snowed all day. The car wasn’t starting that day. Sun
we all stayed home from church. I had them pick up the car Sun
morning. We saw the Beatiles on TV too. Lesle liked them ha!</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
you’re feeling better all the time. You’ll probably be glad when
the cold weather is over, also. Sounds like Bill is with his car (1
yr older than ours – I think) like I am with ours. OK for around
town but not so good on the highway. We used the $1 to help on
chicken dinners sent in last Sun night. Andy got the bond OK. We need
to buy them some more saving stamps. The party not at our house was

– Tues PM – </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Dear
Mother and Aunt Clara, I’m lying on the bed with Andy while waiting
for Ruth. Andy, recently, has refused to look me in the eye unless
I’m feeding him. He used to look at me a lot more but now he always
turns away as soon as he sees me. I guess he knows I’m not the one
he usually gets his milk from, or else he’s just a tease. We were
glad to have your letter today and I guess the call will have to take
the place of the letter for last week. This evening has been better
than yesterday evening. Yesterday Ruth’s jaw was still hurting from
having been to the dentist last Sat morning, and Andy had also made
her quite tired. We went to bed early last night. Andy had a pretty
good night and although he was awake most of the afternoon he slept
awhile this evening and Ruth felt better.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tomorrow
evening is choir practice. We’re taking Ted Jensen, he’s a friend
of ours who says he will help out in the choir. Thurs evening we’ll
stay in. Ruth could go to a meeting but with Lesle’s party on Fri
she thought it would be too much. Lesle is having 4 friends in for
supper on Friday; 2 boys and 2 girls. Sat night we go to the
Cavalitto’s (director of research) and Sun night we have a meeting
at the Hoffland’s. The Laidigs don’t think they will come before
Easter. He had a Dr. appointment in Denver for his eyes, but I guess
they couldn’t find anything specifically wrong. Last Sun we </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><U>all</U></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
went to church. It was Andy’s first time out in public. He ate just
before we left and got along OK in the nursery. We both sang in the
choir for the first time (together) since before he was born. Other
than the regular things I can’t think of what we’ve done. P.S.
Wed AM – Andy looked and looked at me this morning so I’ll
“forgive” him. He slept all night for the first time also.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Wed PM -</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
We just got back from choir practice and refreshments afterwards and
Ruth is ready to feed Andy. He got along fine this evening while we
were gone. He usually stays awake most of the evenings any more. We
had a wet snow today but no freezing so it was OK driving. This will
probably be about our last snow. The grass is already beginning to
green up. Ruth has a meeting in the morning and will take all the
kids, I guess. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>(!)

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
to have your letter today and to know that you’re all OK. Lesle has
worn the new dress this week; Ruth took it up some and it looks fine.
We had your cherry pudding dessert this evening. Ruth was trying it
out before she sends it to a neighbor lady who just had a baby. Ruth
and the kids went over today to see Lesle’s circus at school. Ruth
said Lesle looked more scared than any of the others. Last Sun
morning we all went to church for the 2</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>nd</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
time in a row. We were to have a meeting at the Hofflands Sun evening
but it was postponed since their kids were sick. Last Sat night we
went to the Cavalitto’s (director of research) and then ate dinner
with the Lowell Miller’s – the biochemist at work.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Fri was Lesle’s party which went OK, even though 2 of the 4 kids
invited couldn’t come. 2 extra kids were enough Ruth said. They had
hot dogs, cupcakes, potato chips and 7-up. She got a bride doll, a
big coloring book, a game, 2 books, 2 puzzles, colorforms and a
stick-on doll and a necklace, so I guess she did OK. Ruth made her a
new gold jumper. We haven’t heard when the Laidigs will be coming.
Ruth got over her toothache. Lisa has a pre-school check-up tomorrow.
Andy looks at me a lot more now. Everything else here is about the
same, I guess.</FONT></FONT></P>

Glad to have your letter today and will have to get this mailed
tomorrow if you are to get it by Sat again. I’m not sure I ever
told you that there is a new branch post office out here in that
shopping center (Brettwood Village). It used to be real inconvenient
to have to go all the way downtown to mail packages, or to go to one
of the sub-stations. Yesterday and today have been colder again and
it felt like winter tonight. This should be about our last cold
spell. We had some snow last week and before it melted I made a big
snowman for the kids. It warmed up the next day and all melted. The
roofer was here today and fixed the shingles that had blown loose. We
seem to be right in the path of strong winds and seem to get a few
loose shingles every time there is a strong wind.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>It
was nice you could be with Uncle Clyde on his birthday. Like Bill, we
don’t plan to do anything about a car until June or July, unless we
have a major breakdown. I suppose we’ll get a station wagon of some
kind. We’ll borrow through the Neisler Credit Union (like your
teachers one). Credit Unions seem to be quite popular here in Ill.
Last evening we went to the Community Concert; the soloist was
William Warfield, the Negro bass baritone. He was certainly good. His
accompanist was in A Cappella Choir at KU when I was a sophomore. I
guess I should have tried to meet him. I think he used to sit right
behind me at rehersal.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
Laidigs are not sure when they can come. Mr. Laidig has had some more
check-ups in Denver. Alan still has some ear infection and went back
for a check-up today. The infections around here seem to hang on. One
of the Hoffland kids is sick again, and Mrs. Hoffland had to miss
choir practice tonight. We are getting ready for the Easter services.
We sing next Sun, of course, and then the Thurs service (Maundy
Thurs) a week from tomorrow night. We sing at both services on
Easter. We all went to church again last Sun and Andy got along OK.
It was the 3</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>rd</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
Sun Andy has gone.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tomorrow
Ruth has womens association at noon (they have a chorus singing) and
creative writing group at night. Andy had a check-up last Fri and
weighed 9 lbs 6 oz, the same as Lesle at the same age. We think he’s
going to be like Lesle quite a bit, both in looks and temperament.
The fall pharmacology meetings are in Lawrence Aug 23-27, I believe.
We’ll probably take our vacation to Kansas at that time. Hope Aunt
Clara wasn’t hurt badly from her fall. I can’t think of anything
else special we’ve done.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Thurs AM –</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
Hope this letter finds Aunt Clara feeling better and the rest of you
OK. We had your letter yesterday. It snowed some last night and this
morning and is considerably colder. I guess I’ll have to quit
saying in every letter that we’ve probably had our last cold spell.
The biggest thing I’ve done the last week has been to have the flu.
A week ago this morning I was having chills. I went to bed with
fever, chills, and aches and pains last Thurs night, and it wasn’t
until Sun that I felt like staying up very much. I stayed home from
work on Fri and Mon, and came back Tues. As I recall I missed 4 days
of work a year ago last Sept with the flu or something similar. Maybe
next winter I should take flu shots.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tonight
we have early choir practice and then sing for the Maundy Thurs
service. We missed church last Sun and understand that Dick Hoffland
turned in his resignation as choir director. He is full time at
Milikin University, and has been discouraged with choir attendance
this spring, so its not unexpected. Haven’t heard from the Laidigs
since he went back for a check-up. They were planning to go to
Arizona for awhile so I don’t know when they will get here.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
has been working hard to get the Easter outfits done for the girls.
They’re yellow with capes, I believe. My flu held her up some. Alan
has a new white shirt, bow tie, vest and red coat, the first time
he’s really had any real fancy dress-up clothes, and his first tie.
Yesterday I came home from work early so Ruth could take Lisa in for
her pre-school check-up, and Alan in to have his ear checked. Lisa is
OK and Alan’s ear is just about cleared up. Lisa is running some
fever today, apparently from her vaccination. Andy has been pretty
good recently; he smiles a lot and likes to watch the mobil ? like
toy attached to his cradle. He’s still sleeping in the basket but
will be out growing it one of these times. Haven’t done much since
the last letter since I was down so much. Pete (my assistant) and I
went down this morning and got tetanus shots. I hadn’t had one in a
long time and it’s a good idea to keep them up, especially when
you’re working around animals. I don’t have you’re letter here
(I’m at work) so I can’t remember if you asked any questions. The
fall pharmacology meetings are in Lawrence Aug 23-27. We’ll
probably take our vacation right before that.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Thurs PM – </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
to have your letter yesterday. I’m writing this at work so won’t
make it too long. Glad to hear that everyone is doing better. We
haven’t heard from the Laidigs in a long time. They went to Arizona
with Eldon during his spring vacation and we had a card from there,
but we haven’t heard since. If you can come in May that would be
fine. As I think I said, we will take our vacation right before the
pharmacology meetings on Lawrence about Aug 23-37.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Dr.
Peters is leaving as chairman of the Department of Pharmacology there
where I was in Kansas City. He is going to McNeil Labs (a drug
company) in Philadelphia. Dr. Walaszek, my advisor, you may remember,
might become the new head. Our weather is finally warming up again
today after being chilly. The kids played outside some this morning.
The grass is getting quite green but it’s been too cold to work
outside. Tonight we go to the small discussion group meeting. Last
evening was choir rehersal and refreshments afterward. We were home
Mon and Tues nights. Ruth went to a League of Women Voters meeting
yesterday afternoon. We have a primary election in a week or two.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Sun we all went to church, the choir sang at the early service.
Afterwards we all went over to Mound school and got oral polio
vaccine. Everybody took it right down except Alan, and it took about
5 minutes to convince him that it tasted just like water. We had the
assistant choir director (Milikin graduate student) out for lunch and
he stayed till about 3:30. We were home the rest of the day. Andy is
doing fine. He seemed kinda fussy last night, like his insides hurt,
probably because he had had some Similac, and it doesn’t quite
agree with him like his “regular brand.” He doesn’t like cereal
at all, but loves his orange juice which I sometimes give him. I went
out last Sat to buy the lumber for Alans chest but the stores were
closed so I’ll have to get it this Sat. I can’t think of any
other important things since last week. Hope you have a good trip to
Larnard.</FONT></FONT></P>

I didn’t get a letter written last night since we went to the
Community Concert (Toronto Symphony) and then stopped by Hofflands
afterwards. Today feels like our first real summer day and Ruth said
she might work in the yard awhile. Glad to have your letter yesterday
and sure hope you got over whatever you had. The warm weather should
help. I guess you came to visit us last year in May. Ruth has
Creative Writing Group tonight. Andy is getting lots of personality
now. Went to church as usual last Sun. Haven’t done much else
different. Laidigs got back OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

We’ve just finished our exercises (we started about 5 weeks ago) so
I’ll write this before going to bed. Glad to be able to talk to you
last Sat night over the phone and I imagine we’ll hear from you in
a day or two. Ruth called her folks just after I called you and we
also had a long letter from her Mother on Mon. Her Uncle Earl, the
dentist, has been sick in the hospital. Ruth immediately wrote him a
note. Uncle Earl has an MD son who is a urologist in Seattle. I guess
he had surgery related to that field. The Laidigs weren’t sure
again when they might be able to come. They didn’t think it would
be before June since they’re “booked” up until then.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Danny
Musgrave graduates from high school this year and will go to College
of Emporia next year majoring in music and English. Dave and Dallas
are still in Denver. Dallas is now divorced – he is the one that
worked in Chicago while we were there. Dave works and goes to night
school. We had a letter from Delbert; he’s the one that’s married
and with the army in Germany. Delbert’s just adopted a son.
Deloris’s baby is “cute as a button” and as wide as it is long
according to Danny and Mr. Laidig – they visited them in Manhattan
where her husband is in school.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
you missed the storm. We’ve had several pretty bad storms here but
none in the last few days. We’ve had a lot of rain, however, and
some places in Central Illinois were flooded, I guess. I got the
grass mowed last weekend when it dried up some. The yards are all
green and nice now.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
has a new dress underway in the “sewing department” along with 2
dresses for the girls. I finally got the lumber for Alan’s chest
and got it started last night. It’s the first thing I’ve made out
of wood in years. When I get that done and we get a door for his
closet we’ll have the boys’ room fixed up like we want it. Alan
is really thrilled with the chest. We now have the crib in the living
room and Andy stays in there most of the time. He sleeps in the big
cradle in our bedroom He has outgrown the basket for night sleeping
but still uses it some during the day. It’s still handy for rocking
back and forth.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
went to choir practice tonight. Took a drive out of town a few miles
Sun. The first time we’d been out of town since last Aug. Since my
last letter we’ve had a few meetings etc. Went to Mariners a week
ago Sun night. That’s the Presbyterian group for married couples.
Glad you’re all feeling better. We only had 3 colored pictures of
Lesle so you can keep the colored one. The other colored picture went
to the other grandparents. Aunt Clara can have the black and white
one. She looks shy – like I was I guess. Lesle still loves school,
and seems to be doing lots better in making friends with her
classmates, etc. She sings in her choir on Mother’s Day.</FONT></FONT></P>

Dear Aunt Clara and Mother, We were glad to have Mother’s letter
today and to know that you got to go home from the hospital. Hope
your back and everything is feeling much better by now. Too bad about
Jimmy’s accident, but I guess it could have been worse. We’ll

been real lucky with our children so far – they have not had any
bad accidents, but I imagine they will have some when they get older
and play harder. I said last year we would get them a swimming pool
for the back yard this summer but it’s not definite.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
got over the flu and have felt fine since. The kids still have
touches of colds but are pretty well cleared up now. We’ve had such
cold weather, like you also, I guess, that the kids have not played
outside much. Tomorrow is supposed to be our warmest day in quite
some time. We just got back from choir practice. Our choir director
has resigned and a lot of the members have quit and are leaving town
for various reasons. Our preacher has resigned also so there will be
quite a turnover of people for next fall.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
has an AAUW meeting tomorrow night. Last Sun, Easter, we sang at both
services. The adult choir joined with the high school choir. We might
have to join with the high school students next year to have a big
enough choir unless we can get some new adults out. Andy is just fine
and is a lot of fun with his smiles. He entertains himself quite well
for long periods of time. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Mom

I’m home with the kids while Ruth has gone to an AAUW tea; she
should be home any time now. Andy slept part of the time but is up
now. I gave him some cereal a little while ago. He’s eating more
solids now; as usual, at his check-up last week the Dr. thought he
hadn’t gained enough weight. Actually, he’s just 3-4 oz behind
Lesle at the same stage, and Ruth has been very satisfied with his
progress. Hope you and Aunt Clara both received your packages OK.
This letter will have to take the place of a separate Mother’s Day
card. Lesle’s choir sings tomorrow at the church service but I’m
not sure that she knows the words to her songs. The adult choir sings
through June. This Wed night we’re honoring one of the members who
is moving away. Her husband has been the Dean of Chapel at Milikin
University and is now taking a church in Buffalo, NY.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Wed
- Glad to talk to you last Sat night and hope you can come when you
plan. As I said the choirs sang at church last Sun. Lesle’s choir
sang at the 11:00 service along with the adult choir. The other
children’s choirs sang at the early service. Our pastor is taking a
church in St. Louis and I think I told you the Hofflands had resigned
as choir directors. He is on the staff at Milikin and will take over
some of the duties that Rev Moore had. We were at home Mon night and
will be tomorrow night also. Last Sat night I put up the copper tile
behind the stove and it really looks nice. Last Sun I worked some
more on the boys’ new chest. I used a small power saw I bought some
time ago for the first time. We haven’t started painting it yet.
Last night was the small discussion group at the Hoffland’s. I
don’t know whether we’ll have it next year or not since some of
the people will be leaving. Rev Moore has been leading it this year.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Had
a letter from the Laidigs and they definitely plan to come at the
time they said. Andy is having his cereal right now and is doing
fine. He sits pretty well now although Ruth is “worried” because
he doesn’t turn over and doesn’t lift his head when he’s lying
on his stomach. I’m predicting that Andy will walk by 9 or 10
months. Today is colder and rainy but I guess there is no danger of a
freeze. The grass has been growing so fast with all the rain. For
Mother’s Day I gave Ruth $10 to buy something frivilous, or at
least something she wouldn’t normally buy; she picked out a dress
and some shoes. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>For

will really do some good. Ruth and her dad worked some in the garden
yesterday. I haven’t mowed since you were here so it’ll soon be

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
Laidigs drove on to Indiana yesterday and will come back today. They
will stay through Sun, of course, and then leave Mon since he has a

overnight on their way back home from Judy’s commencement but they
didn’t. They didn’t have time since it wasn’t his regular
vacation time. I wasn’t too tired last week after you left. I was
off Fri, of course, and got the chest all done over the weekend
except for final sanding and finishing. We took the kids out to the
airport on Fri to see the planes off. Sun was the same as usual. Mon
night we looked at the Chevrolets after our neighbor came over. Wed
night was choir practice and Ruth went to a baby shower afterwards
with her Mother. Again, we told our regular babysitter not to come.

to have your letter and to know Aunt Clara was feeling better and
that you had such a good trip to Wichita. It was certainly nice you
could go. We’ve been fairly busy since you left, as you know. The
Laidigs went to Indiana a week ago Thurs and came back about supper
time Fri. When they come this far they usually like to go on to
Indiana for a day or so. They plan to stop here overnight on their
way to Virginia. Eldon and Mary Jane (he’s now a principal of a

their way to New York. Mr. and Mrs. L won’t go till later.</FONT></FONT></P>

too bad. We still need rain. We’ve had to water some in the garden.
Mr. L spaded up some of the garden and planted some vegetables while
he was here. Ruth has picked cherries and raspberries several times
and has given some cherries away. We came over and picked cherries
and raspberries 2 years ago before we moved in, but didn’t have
hardly any last year, apparently because of freezing. I haven’t
spent as much time in the yard this year as last – maybe next year
we’ll have more yard time when Andy is older. As you know we sure
have enjoyed him, however, and there will always be time for yard

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I’ve
only mowed about once since you left since its been so dry and the
grass hasn’t grown much. Last Sat we all went to the Fun Fair. We
ate lunch first (at the fair) and then the kids had a big time seeing
some of the things and riding on some of the rides. Mr. L took Lesle
on the Ferris wheel and Mr. and I took them on a helicopter ride. It
was cloudy most of the time and not as hot as the last two years. It
rained a little while we were there. It’s held in that park near
the church and is sponsored by both the hospital auxillaries to raise
money.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Later
Sat I went down to order a car but they hadn’t been getting exactly
the one we wanted so we ended up with one they had in stock. We
bought it from the neighbor who is a Chevrolet salesman. It’s a 9
passenger Bel Air, all white, station wagon. We like it very much
and, of course, the kids were thrilled. There were 3 babies for the
baptism and Andy was the only one that didn’t cry or fuss while he
was up front. Mr. L took us out to eat after church and by that time
Andy was getting tired and fussy so he made up for it later in the
day. Ruth had a meeting Sun afternoon and Mrs. L went out awhile to
visit a friend. The Laidigs left Mon morning. Like with you we had a
good visit with them and we’re glad you could all come. I guess Mr.
L is about as busy as ever and he said he was in Hutchinson a few
weeks ago doing some hail adjusting (wheat and corn – hail
insurance).</FONT></FONT></P>

Aunt Clara and Mother, This will have to serve as a birthday letter,
which, like Mother’s, will arrive after your birthday is over.
Anyway, congratulations. The last few days here have been hot and
humid. Yesterday evening was especially bad since there was no
breeze. We got some needed rain last night during quite a
thunderstorm. Alan spent most of the night in bed with us. We
certainly have been enjoying the new car. It’s such an improvement
over the old Ford that we really notice it. The kids are thrilled
with it, of course. Our cherry tree has really been producing. We’ve
given a lot of cherries away and still have all we can handle. Have a
lot of raspberries too. Last year we didn’t have any of either,
apparently because of freezing. We would need a deep freeze to store
any amount of them since our refrigerator freezer doesn’t have that
much extra room.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Everything
at work is about the same. I guess the sales of Krem, our new
flavored antacid tablet, are improving. I didn’t have anything to
do with it, but it does help pay my salary. Glad to have Mother’s
letter and hope you had a good trip to Larnard. I have the chest all
ready to paint. My next job will be to build some shelves for one of
the closets. Since we bought the car we didn’t buy the bed and
mattress we went to look at when Mother was here.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Andy
seems to be taking the hot weather pretty well. He sleeps a little
more when its real hot. We sang at the 2</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>nd</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
service this morning and have only next Sun with the regular choir. 2
wks from today Ruth and I are supposed to sing in a quartet. Last
Tues night was the Neisler picnic. The kids had a big time afterwards
on the rides at an amusement park. Wed night I mowed part of the yard
and worked around the house. Late Thurs night Eldon, Mary Jane and
Larry Laidig arrived after a long hot drive from Oberlin. They were
on the way to Virginia where Eldon has some kind of Coast Guard
school, and then they go on to New York for the World’s Fair. We
had thought Mr. and Mrs. Laidig would stop by here on their way to
New York, but Eldon said they may take a bus which would mean they
wouldn’t stop by, of course. Again, Happy Birthday and we’ll see
you sometime in August.</FONT></FONT></P>

I’m here with the kids while Ruth went down to the preacher’s
farewell reception. Andy has been a little upset with the hot weather
and possibly some teething so we didn’t want to get a babysitter.
Lesle and Lisa have had slight colds so they stayed home from church
this morning and I took Alan. It was the last Sun for choir.
Yesterday and today have been above 90 and very hot. Our kitchen air
conditioner helps but we need some kind of fan to help circulate the
air. Glad to have your letter yesterday and to hear about everything.
Sounded like you had a nice trip to Dodge City, Jetmore, etc. It’s
nice you have an air-conditioned car, or you couldn’t make it in
the hot weather.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Did
I ask if Gene Stucky hadn’t gone to work for Fraeze Drugs. That ad
you sent about his new store showed a picture of Gene and said he
worked at his downtown store. If that’s where he is he didn’t
work at the hospital very long did he. We had a Mariners party today
out at a farm, but are not planning to go. The girls have had 2 wks
of swimming lessons and are getting along OK. We couldn’t have done
it if I weren’t in the car pool. Lisa’s lessons are Mon and Fri
at 12:30, and Lesle’s are Wed and Sat at 11:30. Ruth drives them
down to the YWCA downtown each time.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Mon
AM - Ruth is taking several prospective League of Women Voters
members to a meeting tomorrow morning. Andy felt better yesterday
after he got more rest Sat night. He was up most of the night Fri
night. Ruth started the white paint on the chest last night. The
drawers will be red, white and blue. We are still having cherries and
raspberries. Ruth had a meeting last Thurs afternoon. We get the
neighbor girl to come over while they go to swimming lessons. Last
Sun night we went to the park awhile. Fri night we ate at a drive-in
and then went to a drive-in movie. The kids were restless and that
was the night Andy was up so much. Tell all hello.</FONT></FONT></P>

I’m at work now. We had a big rain last night so got some of the
moisture we needed. When you have a big yard it hard to keep it all
watered. The cherries are about gone but we still have a few
raspberries. I had Fri off so after Ruth took Lisa for her swimming
lesson, we all went to Bloomington (North of here) to a nice park
with a zoo, rides and a lake. It was the first time we’d been out
of town since last Aug. Got along fine since it was a cool (for this
time of year) weekend. It was so nice to have a better car to drive
out of town. It was the first trip out of town with it. The kids were
brave, and even used the highest slides in the play area. They
climbed on an old fire truck and saw a big real steam locomotive that
was on display. We stayed home on the 4</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
(Ruth did some grocery shopping in the morning). I cooked on the
grill in the evening. We flew a flag and the kids were thrilled. Ruth
has painted some in Alan’s room and on the chest. It’s just about
done. The quartet went OK yesterday. We practiced last Wed night. We
have just the one service now on Sun morning. The other Sundays in
July we’re supposed to take care of the nursery. They just have a
few babies, however.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Lesle
got sick on the way home from church yesterday, but she seems OK now.
We’ve decided that Andy, at least once for each, has said 4 words –
“Daddy”, “Hi” “Yeah” and “OK”. Last Tues morning Ruth
took 3 guests to the League of Women Voters summer coffee and all 3
are joining. The church had a farewell reception for the Kauls last
Sun afternoon. I guess I wrote that Ruth went. They gave them a big
silver service and a check for $1000. Not so much on this week. The
girls still have some more swimming lessons but are just about
finished. Glad to have your letter and to know everything is OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

Ruth finally finished painting the chest. It took several coats of
paint since it was plywood and the paint soaked in so much. Yesterday
and today are warmer after a cool and rainy spell. We really haven’t
had a bad summer at all so far. It will be hot in the car if the
weather is hot. I didn’t feel we could aford an air-conditioner now
since the’re several hundred dollars, but we’ll make it OK.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
took care of the nursery last Sun but it was no problem since there
was only one other baby besides Andy. Andy is doing fine but he was
up 2 or 3 times last night. I can’t think of much else for now.
Lisa is through with her swimming lessons and Lesle has 2 more. Lisa
claims she “swims” a little bit. Next summer we’ll get some
kind of a pool for the backyard.</FONT></FONT></P>

As usual, I didn’t get this written last night like I thought I
would. Yesterday evening I left our car at the neighbors (the
Chevrolet salesman) so he could take it in today to have the air
conditioner installed. Ruth and the kids were already there so I
stopped in awhile also. I had been in their house a couple of times,
but that was the first time we’d all been there at the same time.
They’re the house on the southeast corner. They are both 42 yrs old
but are always friendly. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Is
it unusual for 42 year olds to be friendly? </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
Lewis’s (house directly east) are some older, around 50, I guess. I
guess that’s still young, ha! The car was ready tonight with the
air conditioner installed so thanks again to Aunt Clara. It has been
cooler yesterday and today but I’ll try it out as soon as it gets
warm again. Ruth and I are going to the movie tomorrow night, without
kids for a change. The paper (10 mins.) I’m giving is on some of
the work I’ve done here. Our plan now is to leave here Aug 12
(Wed). I’ll be off work Fri night before but we’d like 2 or 3
days to take our time getting ready and not rush right off like we
always have before. We’ll stop overnight in St. Joseph and then on
to Oberlin. Stay there 5 days and then on to Hutchinson for 5 days
and then drive to Lawrence Mon morning Aug 24. Hope you had a good
trip to Larned if you went this week. We’ve been having trouble
with the well. Have plenty of water but may have to have it dug up
before long. It started acting up a year ago, but it made it OK
through the winter. Our water softener will probably need replacing
before long, also. Yesterday evening I mowed some in the yard since
it was cooler. Andy was quite a “pill” today. A lot of fussing
and Ruth couldn’t get too much done. She’s still sewing on all
the matching outfits. Sorry to hear about Carl Winner. I, of course
remember him although I never saw him too much. Last Sun morning we
had a 3</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>rd</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
baby in the nursery (1½ mos). I let </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>(let?)
</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
go shopping Mon night since we were through with supper early. I
don’t believe we’ve done much else that’s different. The kids
have been playing a lot with a neighbor girl that they had not played
with before. Hope you’re all fine.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Sat 4:00 PM -</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
Andy just got up from his nap which usually isn’t as long as we’d
like. He’s hardly taking any nap at all in the morning, and not
more than 2 hrs in the afternoon; he doesn’t sleep much more than
the other kids altogether. We’ll take his folding crib on the trip
so he won’t need a baby bed. We’re sure glad we didn’t try to
leave today, as the last week has been kinda “wild.” I got out my
progress report for July-Aug this past week so I wouldn’t have it
to do when I get back. I worked on it some last Sat and Sun. Last Sat
morning I called the well man and he said he could come out on Tues.
We were still getting water, but just barely, and only by turning the
pressure way down did the pump not run continuously. I thought we’d
make it, but I had procrastinated too long and the well finally gave
out Sun afternoon.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
went to lab and got 3 big 5 gal plastic bottles and had to carry in
all our water from Sun night to Wed morning. I brought some as I came
home from work, and got the rest from the neighbors. We didn’t know
where the well was (and the people we bought the house from didn’t
know either) so they had to dig out from the house following the
pipes until they found the well. It is quite a ways out, beyond the
west end of the swing set. Once they found the well it wasn’t too
big a job; the trouble was a hole in one of the plastic pipes going
down into the well. The well has plenty of water but we couldn’t
build up much pressure as it would immediately run back down the
hole. It started about a year ago but we had made it through the
winter without much trouble by turning the pressure. We now have just
about the best pressure we’ve had since we bought the house. The
water trouble was right at our hottest spell. It got above 100
several days; so we were glad for the car air conditioner; last Sun
evening we took a cooling off ride after the water gave out. Sorry I
didn’t have a letter from you by today but maybe we’ll hear Mon
or Tues. We’ll leave Wed AM, and have a reservation at a motel in
Lawrence for the meetings. I’ll get some expense money for that (my
part) of course. We may drive out of town a ways for a picnic
tomorrow. Today is cooler and very nice after our hot spell. Andy
slept clear through last night for the first time. During the hot
spell he was up as many as 3-4 times a night. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Mom

– </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
to have your letter yesterday and to know that everything is OK and
you had a good trip to Larned. We’re having a busy week now also.
Ruth has a board meeting this afternoon for the League of Women
Voters and another meeting for them in the morning. Tonight is choir
practice and tomorrow night an AAUW meeting will be at our house. Fri
I have a dental appointment, regular check-up. Andy had a good
morning and has been much better since he got his first tooth in. We
may get a walker for him. Alan gets along OK while the girls are in
school. They like school OK although they have been kinda irritable
and fighty, probably because the’re more tired. Today is rainy and
its been cool the last few days. Everything at work is OK. My
immediate boss (Dr. O’Dell) left but this hasn’t made much
difference in my work. Glad you saw Elliott.</FONT></FONT></P>

Dear Aunt Clara and Mother, I guess I haven’t sent a letter to you
first since we got back from vacation. Hope you’re all OK; I
imagine I’ll hear from Mother today. You and Mother may keep the
enclosed clipping of Ruth since it’s an extra copy. If we get
another one we’ll send it on. The election in Illinois this fall is
quite different because of some changes in the ballot, so the League
of Women Voters has been busy getting out literature on the changes.
We have choir rehersal tonight. The choir is building up again with
some new students and new adults. We went to our choir director’s
house last Sun afternoon to meet his parents who are here from Utah -
they are both past 80 and are not his real parents, but they raised
him from the time he was a baby, so he feels quite close to them. His
name is Hoffland, as you might remember - they are Lutheran and
scandinavian, but he decided to take the choir for another year. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>In
spite of the fact that he is Lutheran and scandinavian?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Everything
at work is going along about the same. We’re getting some more new
equipment in so we can do some new problems. Andy was quite choked up
with cold over the last weekend so Ruth stayed home with him while I
took the kids to church and sang in the choir. Attendance at church
is way up – there were a lot of people who didn’t come on account
of the former pastor. We have an interim pastor for one year. Andy is
better now and last night slept real well. He still gets up a lot at
night and disturbs his parents sleep. The girls love school and Lesle
(first grade) is, of course, learning to read her first words. Last
Sat evening I took all 3 kids over to school to their money raising
fair (something like the ones I used to give magic shows at). They
raise money for the PTA I guess. Ruth stayed home with Andy. Last Sun
night we had a babysitter and went to a Mariners Club (church group)
progressive dinner at four houses.</FONT></FONT></P>

had rain over the weekend and it has been nice and fall like the last
few days – cool in the morning and then warms up during the day.
Ruth and I both have dentist appointments Fri afternoon. Last Wed
night we all went to the Neisler picnic and did not try to go to
choir practice afterwards. I had my birthday cake when we got home.
Ruth got me a new sport coat which I needed, and the kids gave me
shirt, tie and socks.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Tues PM 7:30 – </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
may hear from you tomorrow but I’ll try to get this off tonight
since I haven’t written a letter since we got back from vacation,
just cards. The kids are taking their baths now so they can get to
bed reasonably early. They need all the rest they can get during
school nights, especially Lesle. Lesle is thrilled about reading and
was reading some to me after I got home from work. She had never been
interested in trying to read herself, before, but now she’s quite
interested. Lisa is still enjoying her kindergarten, also. Alan gets
along fine in the morning and, of course, gets more attention from
Mother since the girls are gone.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
mowed the yard some tonight. We’ve had some rain the last few days
and its been warm and very humid. The Lewis’s across the street
East (older man at Caterpiller) are leaving next week for 6-8 wks in
England. He has to go on business. Bob Burtachi, the neighbor to the
SE is having a garage built.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Andy
is OK. He went to the Dr. last Fri with an ear infection (it kept him
up practically all one night last week) and has been taking oral
penicillin. He goes back to the Dr. tomorrow for a check-up. Andy
sits pretty well now, although he tips if he tries to reach too far.
He still has just the 2 bottom teeth. He eats practically nothing but
table food now, and seems to do OK. Still wants his “brand” milk,
of course.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
called her Mother last night. They’re making a trip to Oklahoma
soon about museums, and then Mr. L goes to the Highway 83 (the one
going by their house) meeting in Texas. Then they plan to drive into
Eastern Texas to Marshall where Judy (John’s oldest) and Ron live.
They both graduated from KU and he’s a chemical engineer there.
They are not sure, but may drive on to Miami, Florida after that to
visit Aunt Lenore (Mrs. L sister) and Uncle Carl (one who had the bad
eye operation and still doesn’t see too well).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Everything
at work is OK. We’ll be getting some more new equipment in and
there is always plenty to do. Dr. Sherrod, our consultant in
pharmacology, was down from Chicago a week ago today (Andy keeps
pushing against me so my writing is not too good). Tomorrow night is
the Neisler fall weiner roast. We may go to choir afterwards if we
get back in time. Ruth’s meeting went OK last Thurs night. Only had
6 ladies (creative writing group of AAUW). Last Wed was choir. Sat
was shopping day since I got paid Fri. Sun I stayed home with Andy
while all the rest went to church. I cleaned Alan’s room, and we
need to paint some of the walls again.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Hope
you’re all OK. Why don’t you plan on a visit here before the
weather gets bad in the winter. I’ll enclose some pictures. Please
return after you’ve shown all and gotten any you want. Also
enclosing a recipe.</FONT></FONT></P>

Well, another week has slipped by. Sorry to hear that Uncle Clyde
wasn’t so good this time, but I guess its to be expected. We’ve
had cool mornings recently and it feels like fall. I guess they
disconnected the thermostat on the car when they put in the air
conditioner so I’ll have to have it fixed before I have heat in the
car. The heater will use the same fan as the air conditioner and the
warm air will come out through the air conditioner. We’ve had the
furnace on at night recently so Andy would be warm.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Andy
still gets up some at night and we wonder if he’s ever going to
sleep through. During the day he’s been a good boy most of the
time, I guess. He sits pretty well now, but doesn’t crawl. I doubt
if he’ll walk for 2 or 3 months yet. He likes to sit in front of
the chest in the living room on which the TV sets and play with the
open doors.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I’m
enclosing another one of the clippings to be kept so each of you will
have one for your scrap books. The League is quite strong here in
Decatur, and in all Illinois, I guess. Ruth’s job this year has
been busier than usual since, as mentioned in the clipping, they are
distributing to various civic and community groups information about
the election in Illinois which will be different this year because
the governor vetoed some bill and some committee failed to act.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
Laidigs are in Abilene, Texas at the highway 83 meeting and will
visit Judy and Ron in Marshall, Texas and then go on to Miami if the
weather is OK. They plan to come back through here, I guess. Lisa
stayed home from school yesterday – said her tummy hurt, but seems
OK today. Andy still has some wheeziness some of which may be due to
teeth. He still hasn’t got any upper teeth though.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
have choir practice tonight. Last Sun morning was world-wide
communion. In the afternoon I practiced for a choir that will sing
next Sun night at a union service. Dick Hoffland is directing. Last
Sat was the biweekly grocery shopping and that usually wears Ruth out
and takes half the day. I used your birthday gift on a $12.95 pair of
heavier wool pants. They are dark brown and go with my new coat.
Thanks. Hope you, Aunt Clara, M.J. Bill and all are OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Wed PM -</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
I’m at home awhile while Ruth goes to a board meeting. All of our
regular daytime babysitters were unavailable today. Andy went down
before Ruth left so he should stay asleep. Lisa and Alan are playing
outside since it’s warmer again today. Lisa had a stomach upset and
missed two days of school but is feeling OK now.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Hope
you had a good trip to Larnard. We had your letter yesterday. Tonight
is choir practice. The choir is building up again; many of the new
ones are students, however. Ruth has womens association meeting
tomorrow. She is still quite busy with League of Women Voters things.
She gets frustrated because the orders are so slow in coming. Her
work should ease up after the election.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Yesterday
evening I put up curtain rods in the boys’ room. As you remember we
had only the red and white stripped shades in there. Ruth has some
white curtains for in there and will put a decorative trim across
their bottoms. She will line them in an attempt to cut out some of
the coldness. Andy is doing a little better at night but had a rough
time recently as he was getting his third tooth through. We may move
him into Alan’s room before too long since sometimes at night we
think he cries because he can see Mama.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
service with the big choir went OK last Sun night. Ruth didn’t go
but stayed home with Lisa who wasn’t feeling well. I put up some
little shelves on the pantry door Sat. We have a throw-cover for the
couch now, also. The slipcover that Ruth made is wearing out pretty
fast so this should keep it looking good for quite awhile yet. Ruth
is doing some sewing in her “spare” time. Has made a dress for
Lisa, started a jumper outfit for herself and has just about finished
a sport shirt for me that she started a long time ago. Everything
with Lesle and Alan is about the same, I guess.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
don’t know when to expect the Laidigs, although I guess it could be
most anytime. Ruth bought a new pair of shoes - medium heel, for
daytime wear. Hope Jana Kay gets better soon. Tell all hello.</FONT></FONT></P>

around to Larnard OK. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>(It’s

</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
have some more pictures to send but don’t have them with me right
now. Thanks for returning the negatives. We have never heard from the
Laidigs but assume that they may come in most any time. They are
probably taking their time along the way and are staying for a good
visit in Florida.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
had the repairman out for the washing machine, so had a $10 repair
bill, also. Tues night I stayed with the kids while Ruth went to an
AAUW meeting. As you may remember she regularly attends two AAUW
groups: contemporary living and creative writing. Last night (Missed
choir practice) the League of Women Voters had a meeting in which
several of the area candidates were presented. I went with Ruth since
the public was invited. It was informative. Tonight is the first
Community Concert, some childrens choir, I believe.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We’ve
been pretty busy at work. I have that paper finished and hope to send
it in before too long. Last Sun morning we all made it to church for
a change. Last Sat night the Mariners group was scheduled to have a
square dance but there was a mix-up and the caller never made it. We
just visited at someone’s house instead.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Andy
is OK but still gets up some. He got those upper teeth and I don’t
believe they bother him quite as much now. He wants to feed himself
now and eats mostly table foods. Lesle is talking about how long it
is until Christmas. Lisa is OK.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Our
days have been typically fall, cool at night and warming up during
the day. Tonight is PTA and we may go see the kids rooms before we go
to the concert. I don’t know about the flu shot, but maybe you
better take it. Ruth got a new green coat. I sure enjoy my new
clothes. Tell all hello and send on to M.J. and Bill if you want to.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Thurs –</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
Glad to have your letter yesterday. I must get to the clippings again
and return the ones you marked. I’m enclosing some pictures again –
take your time with them. Some of the pictures are on Lisa’s
birthday. The red-headed girl was our babysitter of last year, Laura
Brenneman, she’s in college this year. Lisa stayed home from school
this morning as she didn’t feel too well. The kids will wear their
halloween costumes to school tomorrow.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
night was choir practice and there were some meetings today Ruth
could have gone to. There is a church dinner tonight we’re missing.
We just can’t go to everything. Ruth went to AAUW Tues night and
had a League meeting Tues morning. The paper I hope to publish is on
some of the work I’ve done here.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
all went to church as usual last Sun morning. Hope you had a good
trip to Larnard again. Our weather has been nice and warm the last
few days. Finally got the heater turned on in the car. Andy has the 4
teeth and still has trouble with his eating sometimes. He has been
sleeping through till 5:00 AM most of the time, so we’ve been
getting more sleep. Too bad about Willetta and Beebe’s nephew.
Guess that’s about all.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>No
- The Laidigs came in last Sat noon and stayed till Mon morning. They
wouldn’t stay any longer since they had been gone so long and
needed to get back. He helped me clean the sump pump and they took us
all to dinner Sat night at the Redwood. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>(I

– Mon AM - </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Well,
this is our coldest morning of the year as it got down almost to
zero. The babysitter (Mrs. Graber) let the cat out last night when he
got quite wild and he hadn’t returned this morning, so I don’t
know whether he made it through the cold night or not. It snowed some
yesterday also.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
windshield wipers on the car quit working Fri night. We didn’t need
them Sat but yesterday coming home from church at noon it was hard
driving in the snow. Yesterday evening was the advent sing so we went
with the Hofflands rather than risk driving at night (it was still
snowing) without the wipers. The kids were thrilled with the first
real snow but we didn’t let them play out too much because they
still cough some.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
advent sing was all the choirs and some narration. The crowd was held
down some by the weather. Andy stayed with Mrs. Graber and really
missed us, I guess. It was the second time he had been left alone, at
home, without any of his family. The 3 older kids went with us to
church. They have advent candles which they got in s.s. and brought
home to light on each of the Sundays of advent. Glad to talk to you
on Thanksgiving and to hear you had a good get-together. Hope you had
a good trip out to Larnard on Friday.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>At
the Advent Sing the Women’s Association provided wassail and
cookies, which were served by the chancel choir (our adult choir).
Andy is sleeping most of the nights now and feels pretty good
although he still coughs some at night. I doubt if he’ll be walking
by his first birthday; although he might make it. He gets around on
the floor pretty well but its not really a crawl – he just sorta
pulls himself along.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
had her first conference with Lisa’s teacher Tues. She said Lisa’s
only problem is her shyness, but that she’s well able to get along
in school. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>And
thus begins the lifelong stigma of my shyness being labeled as a
problem that needs to be fixed. Sigh. </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
went to her creative writing group Tues night. Wed morning she had a
committee meeting and Wed night was choir practice. Thurs we stayed
home and Ruth fixed a good dinner, chicken loaf, cranberry relish,
peas, pumpkin and pecan pie. Lesle had to stay home from school Fri
afternoon with a fever and was heartbroken but everyone is pretty
good today.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>In
Oberlin Mr. L is president of their museum board. They voted down a
county levy to support the museum since it doesn’t pay for itself
by admissions. Just recently, therefore, they decided to close it
unless town people would come through in support. Sorry I didn’t
call earlier the other day so I could have talked to Aunt Clara also.
I’ll have Ruth write Christmas suggestions. Yes, Decatur has a big
tree in that downtown park but I think it blew over the other night.</FONT></FONT></P>

put the same date on this letter and the previous letter.</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
- Dear Aunt Clara and Mother, I guess its about time I sent one of my
weekly letters to you first. We were glad to have Mother’s letter
this week and to hear about everything. She said you were going to
call about Uncle Clyde. I suppose with winter coming on you won’t
be able to drive out to Larnard as much.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
had our first snow this morning and, of course, the kids were
excited. It is just about freezing so its staying on the ground some
but not on the streets. Its supposed to get colder (in the 20’s)
tonight. This is our coldest temperature so far. I’m driving in the
carpool today (4 altogether). They all went home for lunch so there
was just time enough to take them, eat, and pick them up. We have an
hour for lunch. They don’t all go home every noon, so it’s not
always so rushed. The car seems to work fine although it uses quite a
bit of gas. Like yours, the bigger cars use more gas.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
stayed home from choir practice last night with Andy since he had
tonsillitis. We took him in to the Dr. on Tues and he gave him some
oral penicillin. He had another bout previously and seems to be
starting off with a little more trouble than any of the others. Lesle
has always been the freest of colds, but she, along with Lisa and
Alan, have had colds and coughs recently. So I guess we’ve had our
first round of winter colds, etc. I’ve had some hoarseness for
almost 2 wks.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
haven’t heard any more from the Laidigs for some time. Two of
Ruth’s uncles were sick, as I think I wrote one time. Lesle is so
proud of her school work and says the teacher has several of her
things up. I slipped away from work a few minutes last week and
visited each of their classes. It was visitation during National
Education Week. Ruth went over 2 or 3 times. Took Andy and Alan
along, of course.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
have nothing much else the rest of the week. Ruth went to an AAUW
meeting Tues night. With Andy sick it slows things down. He felt some
better this morning Ruth said. I suppose you keep busy with the
hospital work and all. Mothers letters always seem to indicate that
you two are just about as busy as ever.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
all went to church last Sun morning as usual. They are selecting a
committee to find a new preacher. They have taken their time since
there was quite a bit of dissension in the church. We went to
Mariners last Sun evening and took a neighbor couple. (That’s a
church group.) Hope you’re all OK and tell M.J. and Bill hello.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Tues PM – </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Well,
another week has slipped by. Today is warmer and the snow and ice are
melting some. We had freezing rain and sleet last Fri and the driving
has been slick on the side streets. The new car is heavier than the
old Ford and goes much better on the ice and snow.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
went to a practice this morning for the Christmas program that she
and Kay Hoffland are in charge of for Women’s Association. They
have singing etc. and something about Madonnas. It has been a big job
for her finding just what she wanted etc. She had trouble getting
people to help, also. The program is Thurs at church. Thursday night
is the Neisler Christmas party. Tomorrow night the choir is having
their Christmas dinner at the organist’s house (we won’t have any
rehersal).</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
stayed home from work last Fri with some fever. I went home early
Thurs as I could tell I was getting something. This has been the
worst winter for me in a long time as far as colds, etc. go. I guess
the girls are bringing lots of new viruses home from school. Everyone
has it I guess when you have small children.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Wed
AM - Ruth has another practice or something today, so Mrs. Graber is
coming and will be there when I go home for lunch. Ruth just finished
sewing a baby blanket for some friends. They plan to borrow the baby
basket also. Ruth is making an easy red dress (sheath or something)
which I think she hopes to finish before the Neisler party tomorrow
night.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last

peppy. Got the windshield wipers fixed on the car. Seems like all the
little things always happen at the same time. We’ll get our
Christmas tree this weekend. I don’t know how we’ll keep Andy out
of it since he crawls around and gets into things. I put up a gate at
the basement stairs so he wouldn’t fall down. Andy won’t walk by
his birthday – the slowest of all 4. Feel free to come visit any
time. Nothing new from Oberlin. They closed the museum. Hope you’re
all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

Sorry I didn’t get this off earlier but you should get it Sat if
the Christmas mail isn’t too heavy. Glad to have your letter
yesterday and also the card. It does sound as if Uncle Clyde can’t
last much longer. We haven’t heard any more about the two uncles of
Ruth who are quite sick also.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>It
is colder here today after a brief spell of milder weather. It’s
dark and cloudy, also. It seems like so many of the winter days in
Ill are cloudy. I like the sunshine much better. We went out to the
Christmas tree farm last Sat and got our tree. Its a farm where you
can go in and pick out your own tree where its growing and then they
cut it right there. Lisa’s kindergarten class had gone out the
other day so she was excited about going back. The man has a little
Santa Claus house also.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Thanks
for the check. We haven’t decided yet on what to get. The big
package from M.J. and Bill arrived in good shape the other day by
express. Ruth was gone Thurs afternoon when it arrived so I went down
and picked it up Fri noon when I went to the bank. Ruth’s program
that Thurs noon for the Women’s Association went over real well and
she received many compliments. Her only complaint was that many of
the women that she asked to help her turned her down. Last Thurs
night was the Neisler Christmas party at the country club. Afterwards
we stopped at Lowell Millers (in carpool) new house.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Sat
afternoon Ruth did the grocery shopping and with getting the tree
that about took most of the day. Sun morning was church as usual. We
stayed afterwards to meet some new members. After the kids naps we
went to Millikin to hear the Christmas Vespers. Since we didn’t
have a babysitter I stayed at the back with Andy. He was pretty good
but I only heard about half the program as had to take him out. (I
put the tree up Sun night.)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Andy
is making all kinds of sounds and says one or two more words, I
guess. He can pull himself up to a sitting position but won’t walk
for quite awhile yet. The kids, of course, are all thrilled with the
presents and Christmas tree. We have a strand of outside lights that
I haven’t put up yet. Some of the presents may be late as usual
since none of them have been mailed as yet.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Choir
practice is tonight rather than last night. Ruth did a lot of
shopping last night. We have things we could go to Fri and Sat nights
and Sun afternoon but I don’t know yet which ones we’ll go to.
Mon I’m going to Chicago, and Ruth may go along if the weather is
good and we can drive. Next Tues night is her creative writing and
then there’s the Christmas eve service. Did not see the Nobel prize
show. We have the Christmas tree and presents blocked off so Andy
can’t get them. Tell all hello. Ruth may write cards next. Hope
you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

Thanks to both of you for the Christmas gifts. We’ll let you know
what we use the money for. We were glad to have your long letter with
all the details about Uncle Clyde. It sounded as if everything worked
out for the best. It was nice the weather held OK.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
had the Hofflands over Mon night for dinner. They were the first
people we had had in this holiday season. We sang some afterwards
with the children. Their youngest 2 children, and Lesle and Lisa, are
in the youngest choir (cherub). Mrs. Hoffland directs it. We were
home last night and will be the rest of the week since there is no
choir practice tonight.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Today,
of course, is Alan’s birthday and he’s naturally quite excited.
We’ll have a lot of cake to eat up with Andy’s birthday tomorrow.
We’re staying in New Years Eve. Andy almost stands alone, and is
moving his legs better in preparation for walking. Andy has slept 2
of the last 3 nights in Alan’s room and has got along OK. He
actually has slept later in there since he isn’t disturbed by our
getting up in the morning.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
week, of course, was very busy. Our trip to Chicago was fine as the
weather held clear. Ruth went along and visited a friend and did some
shopping (not downtown where it was very crowded). Martha Napoli (the
lady who is in charge of some of the pharmacology) went along with
her son who was home for the holidays. It was an informal meeting of
the Mid-West Pharmacology Group. I met several new people and saw
some friends. Dr. Abood (who I worked for there) is leaving in June
for Rochester, New York. We had Mrs. Graber to stay with the children
and she said Andy got along fine. He does OK when he’s at home and
the other children are where he can see them. We were home by 9:00
PM.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>A
week ago Sun afternoon we went to a neighbor’s for open house. I
then took all the kids to the church for a Christmas party. Santa
came and that was the only time they got to see him up close. That
Tues night Ruth had an AAUW creative writing group meeting.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Wed
night was choir practice and Christmas eve was the program at the
church with the choir singing some. The children were to sit with a
girl but she never showed up so they had to stay in with the
babysitter. I was off work Thurs afternoon and Fri and will be off
the same this week. I did last min shopping Thurs afternoon in the
crowds. The children were all thrilled with Christmas and had been
excited for days. I’ll write what they got later.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Sat
afternoon I did the grocery shopping and we worked around the house.
Sat night we went to Dave Moses house (sings in choir – older than
we are) for a party with some of his friends. Sun morning was regular
church. Rested Sun afternoon and cleaned up around the house in the
evening. Hope you all had a nice Christmas and thanks again. Love,
Carroll &amp; all</FONT></FONT></P>
