finally learns to walk. His temper is a topic. Mom finally tires of
the endless meetings? The rivers rise, but the dikes hold. The

Dear Mother and Aunt Clara, You probably won’t get this till Mon. I
just didn’t get it off earlier. I’m enclosing some of the
Christmas pictures and those of Alan’s and Andy’s birthdays.
There are some more pictures that I’ll send at another time. Its
been real warm here for several days but is due to get colder
tonight. Its rainy today. We’ve sure had a mild winter so far.
Hardly any snow at all. Ruth went to a meeting yesterday morning and
we both went to choir practice Wed night but not much else this week.
Stayed in most of New Years vacation also. Had church, of course, on
Sun.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
had some neighborhood ladies in for coffee on Mon morning, and Wed
morning Alan had his birthday party with 2 other 4 year old boys and
their Mothers in. His party was postponed a week because he had an
eye infection and one of the other boys was sick also. His eye
cleared up OK. Andy had it first, and Lisa did too.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Had
a letter from the Laidigs, and Mr. Laidig will have prostate surgery
in Denver on Jan 20</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>.
Ruth is knitting me a scarf. Its her first attempt at knitting and it
looks real nice. Andy is doing better about “walking” when we
hold him. He might have been practically walking by now if we hadn’t
carried him around so much. We’re using some of yours and Aunt
Clara’s Christmas gifts to buy a good Early American wastebasket
for the living room, and some Eagle hangers for the bathroom door.
Hope all are OK.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>1-20-65
– </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
you got the pictures and everything. Yes, we got your picture and
like it fine. I simply forgot about it in my last letter. I’ll
enclose another batch of pictures for you to take your time. Some of
these were Christmas, and the one of the 3 kids with the funny faces
was after we had been over to the Mound School Fair last fall.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>That
certainly is a surprise that Bill and M.J. will be coming to
Hutchinson. That sounds like a pretty good salary. I’m sure a
comparable job would be higher here since we’re closer to Chicago;
etc. where salaries would run higher but living costs and housing
would probably run higher here than in Kansas. I may have mentioned
that my raise was the usual 5%.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
night was Community Concert – a lady violinist. Tonight is choir
practice, but Ruth has a slight fever and may not feel like going.
Lesle has missed some school. Andy is pretty clear now, but I believe
it’s been our worst winter for colds etc. I still have some more
clippings to return. You can consider Aunt Clara’s thank you letter
as part of yours for the week. I think she mentioned some of the
things the kids got for Christmas. I got a new billfold, and Ruth is
now knitting me a scarf (about 2/3 done) think I mentioned.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
says “thanks” for the check. She will buy a recorder instrument
with it. Our early American wastebasket came which we got with part
of your gift, and is real nice. I got Ruth a record HMS Pinafore
(light opera) for her birthday, but it hasn’t come yet. Each of the
kids is giving her some material from her new fabric of the month
club. Her folks sent her the subscription. Every month you get
samples of fabrics from different countries. It costs a few dollars
just to join and get the samples, and that was the Laidig gift. The
kids gifts will be for her to actually buy some for sewing. She says
she is knitting me a sweater when she finishes the scarf. I’m at
work so must stop. Glad you’re all OK there. Haven’t done much
unusual since I wrote last. Mr. Laidig’s operation is today.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>1-28-65
– </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
to have your letter and to hear about everything. We had some snow
overnight and it is much colder today. That big snow we had was all
melted. We had some rain which helped. We haven’t done much since I
wrote last except try to recover from quite a round of heavy colds,
coughs and maybe some flu. Ruth and I both had it the worst – mine
was about a day later than hers. Ruth stayed down a week ago
yesterday, and I went to work. A week ago today I came to work since
it was my turn to drive. I went home then thinking I could help as
Ruth was still down. I begin to feel worse by then and so I stayed
home most of Thurs and Fri. Fri was payday so I did come in for my
check. We were down most of the week-end but were feeling better by
Sun. I’ve been to work all week, but was weak Mon. We still cough
some but will get clear over it soon, I hope. There has been quite an
epidemic here, I guess. The girls have both missed some school. Lisa
was still running some fever yesterday so we took her to the Dr. Her
lungs were clear. One of the fellows I ride with has a girl in the
hospital. I guess we’ve been lucky since we’ve never had a child
in the hospital.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Andy
was real good while Ruth and I were down and couldn’t take care of
him so much. He ran a little fever once but has been about the
wellest of all of us. Alan had some fever also. Anyway, it was about
the worst round of infection since we’ve been married because we
all got it at about the same time. I don’t believe Ruth and I have
had coughs like this since we’ve been married.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Hope
you all have escaped (and M.J. and Bill) getting clear down. I guess
there was 15-20% absentees over at Mound School one day. We missed
choir and church Sun of course and a dinner that evening with the
Mariners group. Ruth went to creative writing Tues night, and we
missed choir practice last night. I’ll go to the men’s group at
church this evening.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>A
recorder is a small wind instrument you play and it costs under $10.
I’ve been working on our income tax. We should get a nice refund
since we haven’t claimed Andy as an exemption. Ruth called her dad
one evening and I guess his growth wasn’t malignant. He was still
pretty weak. Ruth watched the inauguration Wed as she was lying down.
Hope all are well. If Aunt Clara goes South why don’t you come here
awhile.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Thurs AM – </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
may have a letter from you today. Our mail doesn’t come until
afternoon. We did receive your card. I sent a birthday card to M.J. I
mailed it last Sat so you probably didn’t see it. We’re still
having 0 weather. We had 6 days in a row with temperatures dropping
below 0 at night. It’s supposed to warm up slightly now. We’re
pretty well over the colds and all now. The girls have been at school
all week. We still have some runny noses and I cough some. I hope we
don’t have any more this winter. We went to choir practice last
night and there were several people out and in bed with something. At
work there were 4 or 5 of the fellows where the whole family got down
like we had.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
has a meeting this morning and one this evening. She says she’s
going to cut down on some of her outside work when some of her terms
are up so she can catch up on things around the house. I’m wearing
my new scarf which she finished kniting. She’s now working on a
red, white and blue pillow for the couch. She seems to really like
knitting. She had never done it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Andy
is almost standing alone, but is in no hurry. We’re leaving his bed
out in the living room so he can stand more. We haven’t encouraged
him much on the standing. The kids are all busy making valentines for
everyone. The girls had their school pictures taken recently so we’ll
probably send you copies.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Haven’t
heard from the Laidigs for several days, but expect he’s going home
to Oberlin (from Denver) about now. Eldon (the school principal my
age) is there so it makes it nice for them to have a place to stay.
Your new superintendent is from the same school system (Arvada, Colo)
where Eldon is.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Hope
you had a good trip to Newton. M.J. must be really liking her organ
work. We still have snow on the ground as it’s been too cold to
melt. Next Mon Ruth and I are driving to St. Louis. We’ll take that
lady who went to Chicago with us, and while Ruth shops we’ll visit
a lab to observe a technique. We all made it to church last Sun.
Didn’t have an anthem, just a solo. Hope you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

I guess another week has passed by. Glad to receive your letter this
week. Yes, the cat returned that time or two he stayed out in the
cold. He was in the garage last night but usually goes in the
basement at night. Once in awhile a neighbor cat comes around. We
don’t let Spotty out when he comes around since they usually fight.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Andy
wants to stand a lot, but still can’t really stand for any length
of time without falling. He can reach the floor now in his little
jumper chair (the one we put him in to feed him) so he wants to stand
while he eats. We’re having a hard time getting him to eat the
canned baby meat which he was eating fine. Now all he wants is bread
and butter and other more tasty things that he has been exposed to.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Mr.
Laidig is getting along OK but is still weak. The last we heard they
were still in Denver but could be home. Both of those uncles of
Ruth’s that were sick have died in the last two months. They were
the two that lived in Danbury. The wives don’t get along too well,
which is unfortunate since they just live a few blocks apart. We
always visited both places when we went over to Danbury. One was the
dentist brother of Mr. L.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
night was choir practice and tonight is a play but I’m not sure
we’re going since we’re having company tomorrow night and we need
to clean the house. Next Wed night there will be no choir practice
because the Concordia College (Minn) Choir will be here. That is
where the Hofflands went to college.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Sun night was the first of 4 family nights at church. We all went and
ate there. Took Andy’s chair, but he was so excited with all the
people that he didn’t eat much. The program was given by a Korean
missionary. Ruth had a luncheon yesterday noon and a meeting this
morning. She will be glad when some of these meetings stop. We did
not go to St. Louis Mon since our babysitter was sick. Sorry to hear
about Mrs. Harbaugh. We had a warm spell with some rain but it is
colder today. Went to church as usual last Sun. Ruth had a meeting
and did some shopping on Sat. Can’t think of anything else. Hope
Aunt Clara has a good trip.</FONT></FONT></P>

– We were slow getting the kids Valentines off, also. Our greetings
will just have to be verbal also. Everything is OK. This is a pretty
busy week. No snow here. Hope Aunt Clara has a good trip. I’m at
work.</FONT></FONT></P>

Well I guess its been 2 weeks since I last wrote. We had a real
blizzard yesterday and last night, and it’s still blowing and is
very cold today. We drove to choir practice last night without any
trouble, but I had trouble getting the baby sitter home. This morning
it was my turn to drive and our regular driveway was drifted shut so
we all parked in front of the building on the grass where it wasn’t
drifted.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tonight
is the men’s meeting where the scouts are invited. Our speaker is
Dr. Martin’s (our interim pastor) son from Indianapolis, so I hope
he makes it OK. I guess Kansas got some of the last storm when we
missed out, and we got this one which parts of Kansas missed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
to have your letter yesterday. Hope you got Aunt Clara off OK and I
suppose you’re in Newton now. Hope M.J. and Bill can find the house
they want. At least they’ll have plenty of time to look. When we
moved here we only spent about 2 days looking, but have not regretted
our choice. Being close to school has been nice this winter in the
bad weather.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
had a meeting Tues morning and AAUW in the evening and had a group in
during the afternoon. Yesterday morning she had another group to
attend. She had another meeting this morning but didn’t go because
of the weather. I drove home this noon for lunch and didn’t have
any trouble. We’ve all been free of colds and everything since that
last bout so hope we don’t have any more this winter.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Our
big news here at work this week is that we have been purchased by
Union Carbide one of the giant chemical companies. The enclosed
clippings explain it all. It should be an opportunity for expansion
and growth and there is no indication that the labs and plant here
will be moved from Decatur. It was just announced Mon so it will
probably be several months before we know exactly what will happen. I
hope that I can assume more responsibility etc.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Our
speaker for tonight can’t come from Indianapolis so we’re having
to find some substitutes. Everything else has been just about the
same the last two weeks. Our cat was gone for a whole week during
some of the coldest weather. Another cat (kitten) came around and I
told the kids they could keep it if it stayed and Spotty didn’t
return. Hope you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>3-4-65
– Thurs AM -</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
Well another week has gone by. Sorry you didn’t get to make your
trip now, but the weather is uncertain in the winter. We had another
snow last night of 4-6 inches. When we left for choir practice about
7:30 it was clear, but when we came out of the church about 10:00 1
to 2 inches had already fallen and we were quite surprised. It was my
morning to drive and it was slick. It was a week ago this morning
that we had that last big snow and it was also my turn to drive in
that one ha! The last one was bad because of the drifting etc. Since
the last one it had warmed up some and it had all melted. Maybe you
folks will miss this one.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
selling of our company was not a complete surprise but to whom it
would be sold was a well kept secret here in Decatur. Some had heard
on the outside that it would be Union Carbide. We are one the last
small drug companies to be bought by a larger corporation. As I said
it’s almost certain that the company will remain here. Union
Carbide has no other pharmaceutical facilities anywhere else so it
would be impractical to move us from here. We have enough land around
the labs out here to build all that is necessary for a good sized
company. As you may remember our bottleing and manufacturing are in
another building downtown. We, of course, will switch over to Union
Carbide benefit plans etc. Neisler will still have its own Credit
Union (like savings and loan). The major reason for selling was that
our sales had been pretty much the same for a number of years and for
the company to grow like it should would require expenditures for
growth that would cause us to operate in the red for several years.
They felt that would be too big a risk to take for a company of our
size. Mrs. Kirkland </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>(the
owner of Neisler) </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>is
somewhere in her 70’s I guess, and reminds me of you in having been
left with a business to carry on as best she could. She will stay on
the Board of Directors, but Union Carbide men will have the biggest
say.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Hope
you’re over your flu. We were free of colds all of Feb but Andy now
has a runny nose and cough and Alan has had some cold. Went to the
last dinner (family) at church last Sun night. A week ago today we
had the preacher talk at the men’s meeting in place of his son who
couldn’t make it. Tonight I go with Ruth to an AAUW dinner meeting.
Lesle’s birthday party is Sat and she’ll take refreshments to
school tomorrow.</FONT></FONT></P>

This week hasn’t been quite as busy for me as the last one was. I
had a couple of reports to write and just didn’t get around to your
letter. Glad to have your letter and the clippings. The local high
school team is also going to the state tournament. Our babysitter on
Wed nights couldn’t come a week ago because she was going to the
game. Hope your entertaining went OK, and glad Aunt Clara is feeling
better.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
finished my sweater (sleeveless – gold) and I wore it to choir
practice last evening since it was colder. It is quite a bit colder
today and windy so I’m wearing it again. Her next project is
another pillow cover for the living room. Ruth had an AAUW meeting
Tues night and is going to Women’s Association at the church this
morning. She went to the eye doctor yesterday and so will be getting
new glasses. That headache she had one day may have been partly due
to eyes. I’ll need to go too as my eyes have gone down since I last
had glasses – about 5 years ago. Our kids, you know, will probably
be nearsighted and may need glasses before too many years. They had a
check-up some time ago and he thought Lisa would be the first one to
need glasses. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
was indeed the first one to get glasses. I got my first pair when I
was not quite 7. </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Nearsightedness
is to a great extent inherited and Ruth and I are, of course, both
nearsighted.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Everything
at work is about the same. The Union Carbide men haven’t been out
yet to explain the employee benefit programs, etc. We’re
advertising now for another pharmacologist and will probably need
more than that in the future. This Sat we’re taking the kids to a
Millikin University play. The choir is starting to practice the
Easter music.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
local hospital (there are 2 and this is the independent one – the
other is the Catholic) is having a $2,000,000 fund raising drive for
expansion. They hope to borrow the remaining $2,500,000 they need.
It’s the hospital where Andy was born and where Ruth was that time
she hit her head. Church has been as usual the last two Sundays.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Andy
is getting around better but doesn’t walk yet. We let him crawl all
over the house except into the bathroom. When he sees the bathroom
door open he hurries to try and get in. He is a real “pill” and a
lot of fun when he’s good. He’s eating better again after some
fussyness over teeth, I guess. The kids wore green to school
yesterday. Tell M.J. and Bill hello and hope you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

Everything is fine here except we’re still having some real winter.
We’ve had more cold and it has snowed some more. Hope you folks
didn’t get as much cold as we’ve had. As soon as it warms up a
bit I’ll get some fertilizer and crab-grass killer for the lawn. We
haven’t put any fertilizer on since we’ve been here and it needs
it badly. We’ll have to buy a fence to make a play area (not the
entire yard) for Andy as he goes everywhere now and is getting into
everything. Ruth had a conference with Lesle’s teacher (they have
one conference a year in place of report cards) and Lesle is doing
fine. Lisa does fine also. Glad to have your letter on Tues and to
hear about everything.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Haven’t
had many changes at work yet but there undoubtedly will be some.
Several of the Union Carbide men will be out at various times during
April. Had a Presbyterian Men’s breakfast meeting this morning at
the YMCA. Several reported on the national meeting held at Chicago.
Maybe I can go next year.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
missed a meeting today because she couldn’t get a babysitter. She
had creative writing Tues night and we went to choir practice last
night. Tonight a fellow (bricklayer) is coming out to look at our
fireplace and see how much work it will take to finish it. As you may
remember, the outside is all finished, but the fire bricks on the
inside were never all put together with cement.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Sun night was a meeting of Mariners and on Sat afternoon we took the
3 older kids to see the play “Once Upon A Mattress.” Its that
play based on the fairy tale about the princess that slept on the
mattresses under which a pea had been placed. The kids were thrilled
since it was the first time they had all been to a live play. We left
Andy at a babysitter’s house nearby. He gets along better now when
he is left with someone new although he naturally doesn’t like it.
I can’t think of anything else right now. Come up sometime when the
weather is warmer. We’re starting to practice our Easter music at
church. We had a long rehersal last night. Hope you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

were glad to have your letter and enclosures yesterday. Today is our
warmest day (in the 60’s) after the third coldest March in history.
As I left at noon Ruth said she would take the kids out this
afternoon and work in the yard awhile. Ruth finished a new dress for
Lisa and she wore it to school for the first time today. Lesle missed
last Fri, and Mon-Wed of school this week with a virus of some type
in her neck </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>(?)</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>

the Dr. on Fri I believe.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
is starting to make the red slip-cover for that old green chair that
belonged to her grandmother. She had a League meeting Tues night and
we both went to choir practice last night. I stayed home Sun morning
with Lesle and Andy (he wasn’t sick). Ruth and I have both had some
sore throat. Ruth has an AAUW branch meeting tonight but she may not
go. She got her new glasses yesterday and says her eyes feel much
better.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
have some Union Carbide men here today and tomorrow. Tomorrow they
will discuss the employee benefit programs etc. Plan on coming up
whenever you want to. How old was Dr. Thorn and what was his trouble
– I remember you mentioning it. I assume he had taken a church in
Texas. We are still looking for a minister at church, I guess. I was
in that band program in 1943 since my name was listed. I sorta
remember it. A lot of the names were familiar. My high school class
is having a reunion in July. I assume you sent them my address.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>This
is grocery shopping weekend and I’m getting the fertilizer. They
need the student center for the Baptists at KU. The Presbyterians
have had a new one for some time now. I remember Norman Godbey and
the name Mrs. Cordingly. I remember Mr. Lewis Hamilton and his son
the minister. Your blood pressure doesn’t sound too bad for your
age and everything. Andy is the same – not walking yet but there is
no hurry. One article said children sometimes develop eye
coordination etc. better when they crawl and creep a lot. Give to
Aunt Clara and hope she and M.J. and Bill are OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

It’s finally warmed up the last two days and it really feels like
spring. I spaded a little in the garden last Sun and Ruth has worked
a little outside. We’ve had some rain also. Glad to have your
letter yesterday. Lesle got along OK. Ruth and I still have a slight
touch of something in our throats, and we’re a little more tired
than usual. I guess we have spring fever.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Andy
is fine. I fixed one of the old high chairs and he’s using it to
eat in. He was about to tip the little jumper chair over. As I said
he goes everywhere and we really have to watch now that the weather
is warmer and the doors open more. The kids are careless about
leaving doors unlatched and the basement stairs gate unlocked.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
took a guinea pig in a cage home from work yesterday so Lisa could
take it to school today for her show &amp; tell. Lesle wants to take
it next Tues. Tonight is PTA but I don’t know whether we’re going
or not. Last night was choir practice as usual.  The choir sings at
the Good Friday service but not at the Mundy ? Thursday one. We, of
course, sing Easter Sun morning.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Fri the Carbide man was here to explain the benefits, etc. They have
some cheap life insurance and a savings plan that is pretty good but
some are disappointed because the Neisler Profit Sharing Plan stops.
They had put 15% of our salary into that every year. We can get it
back at 10 yearly payments if we quit but it won’t be increased
from now on. It was sorta a pension plan. Carbide, of course, has
their own retirement and pension plans, but they don’t mean to much
to me right now.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Sat Ruth did the grocery shopping and I bought some fertilizer and
crab grass killer in the morning. We made it to church as usual on
Sun. I believe we were home both Mon and Tues nights. Ruth is
finishing knitting that second pillow for the living room, and
working on sewing that red chair cover. Everything else is the same.
I have a dentist check-up in the morning. Hope you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

Well another week has slipped by. Glad to have your letter yesterday.
We also had a letter from the Laidigs yesterday and they plan to come
here a week from Sun - April 25. I suppose they will stay a few days.
Why don’t you come after they are here. With the Mississippi River
rising I don’t know whether they will have any trouble going
through Hannibal Missouri, or not. Even the trains might be delayed
with the high water. The floods and tornadoes have sure been
terrible. I wonder if Richard Searl has been affected there in Minn.
We missed all the storms that produced the tornadoes, but have had a
lot of rain. It rained and was cold last Sat and then was a lot
warmer and windy on Sun. Towards evening I noticed that it had cooled
down considerably. Ideal conditions for tornadoes, I guess.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
and I worked in the garden awhile Sun afternoon and we planted a few
vegetables. I washed the car later. Tues evening was Frank Guerrera
(baritone) at the Community Concert. He is from the Metropolitan
Opera and was very good. Last night was choir practice and it was
extra long because of the Easter music. Tonight is communion service
at church and tomorrow night the choir sings at the Good Friday
service.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Its
too bad about Mrs. Harbough, I suppose she’ll gradually get worse
but maybe they can arrest it. Sun morning we sing at both services so
we’ll have to get up earlier. This noon Ruth has Women’s
Association at church. She’s singing in a little chorus. Next Tues
night is the big meeting at our house. It’s the contemporary living
group of AAUW. I’ve gotten over my throat but Ruth still has her
sinus trouble. It seems to have developed after she had been here
about 2 yrs. This is a bad place for sinus and respiratory trouble.
The kids are all OK and the same. Andy gets around, but still doesn’t
walk. Hope you’re all OK. I’m off work tomorrow, but I don’t
know whether we’ll go anywhere or not. Tell all hello.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Well another week has passed. The last few days have been very
nice and spring like. Glad to have your letter yesterday. Your plans
for coming sound fine. I guess the river is still flooding but I
guess there is no problem with the trains getting through, as far as
I know. You would go through St. Louis, I guess and I don’t think
it gets so bad there.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
have a mens meeting at church tonight. Its the meeting that honors
the graduates. Dr. Martin’s (our interim minister) son will be the
speaker. He is the one who couldn’t come in Feb because of the
snowstorm. Tomorrow I’m riding to St. Louis with some of the people
here to visit another laboratory and to see how they set up certain
things. I’ve never been to St. Louis since we’ve been here.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
night was regular choir practice. Ruth’s folks should be here
sometime Sun. They will probably go on over to Indiana for a day or
so and visit relatives. Mon night we worked around the house and Tues
night Ruth had her big meeting (Contemporary living group of AAUW). I
guess there were 26 - 28 ladies. Thats about maximum capacity for our
living room. She had red geraniums for the big mortar on the floor.
I’m not sure I told you that we bought a new lamp (apocathary type)
for the end table. Its looks real nice.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
worked in the yard some yesterday and I got the fertilizer and crab
grass killer on last weekend. This morning Ruth took Andy, Lisa and
Alan to have gamma-globulin shots. They were exposed to the measles
at church so if they get them it will be a milder case. Easter Sun
went OK. We made it to the early service in time. Sat we went to the
art museum to see some of the grade school childrens work. Fri was
off so I worked in the yard some.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Thanks
to both you and Aunt Clara for the Easter cards and notes. Hope you
had a good trip to Ottawa. Nice to hear about Mrs. Thorn. Our kids
really liked “Mary Poppins.” Whats Norman Perrill getting his

get your letter written yesterday. Everything is fine here. Have had
a good visit with the Laidigs. They got in about supper time Sun.
They went to Indiana on Wed. Andy wasn’t too sure of them at first
but then got along fine. They are leaving this morning. It has been
very cool but warmed up yesterday. Ruth went to the dentist Mon but
didn’t have to have her tooth pulled. The Laidigs brought some
plants for the yard. Glad you had a good trip to Ottawa. Hope you get
this before you leave. We’ll be looking for you. Hope you’re all
OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

Well, I guess its been about 2 weeks now since I wrote last. We had a
big 5 inch rain night before last, and with some additional rain a
week ago, our drought has been broken. We’ve had a lot of flowers
and had some peas from the garden last night. We should have some
cherries and raspberries, also. Ruth’s Uncle Edgar and Aunt Dova,
from Norton, Kans (East of Oberlin) are supposed to stop through here
on their way to a family reunion in Ohio. He is a farmer, partially
retired, and often goes to Hutchinson for the State Fair, and he has
been on the Kansas State Agricultural Board.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Would
you please send me poems and clippings to help on a 10 min devotional
for Father’s Day. Our mens breakfast meeting at church is on
Fathers Day I believe and I have the devotional. It wouldn’t have
to be about Fathers Day, I guess. It will be out of doors so maybe
something related to nature?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
to hear about Aunt Clara’s driving test. As I said over the phone,
I think the results were very good for her age. There are very few
people who even try to drive when they are past 80. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Mom

bad about Aunt Nellie. Mr. Hoffland has gone to Utah to be with his
father who at 82 is having a cancer operation.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
has about finished her quilt for the baby. She stayed in for about 3
days with a slight fever and virus, I guess. She was never clear down
so it didn’t make it too bad for me. She stayed home from choir
practice last night while I went. She seems about over it today. She
has a meeting tonight that she may miss.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
all went to church as usual last Sun. Last Mon was vacation and we
worked in the yard. I reworked the rock border on that flower bed on
the West. Andy is walking more by himself now, and has been happier
since he got a tooth through. He still has some real temper, however.
School will be out this week. Bible School starts in a week or so, I
guess. I’ll have to mow this weekend after all the rain. I suppose
M.J. and Bill are about to move by now. Glad they sold their house.
Everything at work is about the same. Our regular vacation period is
July 12-25, so I suppose we’ll come to Kansas for part of that. We
may take the rest of it around the time of the fall meetings in
Philadelphia, Aug 16-20. Hope you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

Well, it’s Thursday again. We’ve had quite a bit of rain and it
looks like it might rain again right now. Glad to have your letter
and the clippings. I’m sure I’ll use some of them. There probably
won’t be too many there at the breakfast. The men’s group at the
church is largely older men. I’m about as young as any of them.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
news this morning said there was flooding at Sedgwick, Kansas. The
farmers like the rain here since its needed for the corn. We don’t
know yet when we’ll come to Kansas, since we haven’t heard when
the Laidigs will be gone. I’m enclosing some clippings about a gift
Mrs. Kirkland gave to the University. There has been a real need for
a new fine arts building. There present auditorium is not very
satisfactory.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
didn’t have any choir practice yesterday evening so I softened the
water for the first time since we bought the new softener. I think
I’ll buy a big fan this weekend. I’ll get one thats up on a stand
so Andy won’t get into it. Andy is walking real distances now, when
he has his shoes on, and is pleased about it. His “temper” has
improved some I guess although he still pretty particular about what
he thinks he wants to eat.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Hope
the folks moved OK. Was home for lunch when the astronots came down.
Ruth has been taking the kids to Bible School every morning this
week. Looks like they will get wet this morning. We have a party at a
choir member’s house tomorrow night, and then Sat is the Fun Fair –
rides etc. to raise money for the Hospital Auxillaries.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
Aunt Nellie is OK. Hope Aunt Claras trip is OK. I suppose she’s on
the way now. The new drug is dimethyl sulfoxide it is still in the
experimental stage, and is not on the market. It is supposedly good
for arthritis and many other things. The girls had good report cards.

working down at the intersection of the highway and Pershing Road
(where I turn for work) and its all torn up and only one lane
traffic. We go another way on the way to work.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
had our last choir practice last night. We sing the next two Sundays
and are then off the rest of the summer. Last Tues night was the
Neisler picnic and the kids were quite excited since they got free
rides at Joyland. Last Sat was the Fun Fair and the kids had rides
there also (that’s the benefit for the hospitals). We all rode the
ferris wheel, except Andy. We ate lunch there. We all went to church
as usual Sun. Next Sun morning is that men’s breakfast. Ruth has
taught Bible School this week and I think they about wore her out.
She didn’t teach last week but took over for a teacher who had to
quit.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Things
should pick up some at work before long as we’ll be receiving a lot
of chemicals from other Union Carbide Laboratories to test. We heard
that report about Oberlin having a heavy rain and flood so Ruth
called home. I guess they had about 5 inches and the Laidigs had
about 6 inches in the yard but only a little in the basement. When
Ruth was little they had a flood and water went through the house.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Thanks

Dear Aunt Clara and Mother, This will have to be a belated birthday
greeting to you Aunt Clara. We certainly thought of you but just
didn’t get a card off. We were glad to have Mother’s letter
yesterday and to hear that the dikes will probably hold. We, of
course, hear about the floods on the news. Today they said they
thought the dikes would hold at Great Bend and the newspaper
clippings from Hutchinson sounded as if they expected no trouble
there. That was too bad about the flood at Newton but as the
clippings said not all cities have dikes as yet.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
suppose M.J. and Bill will be moved before too long. I imagine the
church at Newton will miss M.J.’s organ playing. We have to sing in
choir this Sun, and then we’ll be through for the summer. We may
leave here about July 10 (Sat) and go to Oberlin by Sun. Stay there 2
days and on to Hutchinson from about Wed-Fri - and then stop in
Kansas City on the way back. We’re not planning to take the full 2
weeks in Kansas since the pharmacology meetings are in Philadelphia
in Aug and we plan to go there and take the rest of the vacation
then. We’ll try to visit Ruth’s brother John in NJ.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
you had a good trip to Ness City. I guess they don’t flood much
there, do they? I’ll enclose the letter from Charles and Cooly that
Mother sent. Aunt Nellie seems to have done real well. Maybe we can
drive up there sometime. I’m getting new glasses tomorrow. My eyes
are still going down some; from all the reading, I guess. My
devotional went OK at the men’s breakfast last Sun morning. I used
the topic of nature rather than Father’s Day.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
took the kids to see the movie Cinderella after work yesterday. Andy
got tired and hungry and I had to walk with him about half the time.
We’ve been home the other nights this week and have worked in the
yard some. We’ve had raspberries, cherries and some beans and peas
from the garden. Hope your birthday dinner was nice. I got 2 shirts,
one pant, and one pair of socks and one short pants for Father’s
Day. Hope you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

M.J. and Bill are moved by now.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
helped my technician move some last night and we gave him our old air
conditioner. That’s the one we bought used in Kansas City from some
friends. I think we used it two summers – once in Kansas City and
once in Chicago. Pete Luna, my technician, has two small children and
they have lived for three years in a noisy apartment. He wanted to
own his own home so they bought a real nice little house. We’ll
give him our old clothesline poles, also.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Its
been cool here again and rained some last night. Had a flat tire on
the car yesterday and had it fixed in the afternoon. I may soon have
another technician under me and some increased work to do. It’s
something I asked for earlier. Our new pharmacologist starts Tues –
he’s supposed to move in today.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
had a coffee yesterday morning for some of the neighborhood ladies –
partly because one of the neighbor ladies sister is here for her

today for a visit. He has been testing some of the Carbide chemicals
in Pittsburgh.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Sun was the last choir for the summer. Mon night we took a picnic to
the park. I pulled weeds in the garden Tues night after we’d had
some rain. We’ve had quite a few raspberries. Andy hasn’t eaten
much for a couple of days, and has been fussy at mealtimes. I suppose
he’s cutting some more teeth. He walkes pretty well now and doesn’t
like to be left inside his fenced (wire fence in sections we bought)
in play area in the yard. He want to explore everything.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
has been sewing some and knitting. She made matching dresses for the
girls and is working on matching shirts for the family. I’ve had my

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>It
rained some this morning and looks like its going to rain again right
now. We had a good 4</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
of July weekend. I had Mon off, of course. Last Fri night we ate at a

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Sun
we all went to church and s.s. (no choir) and then we had Don Pettit
over for dinner. He used to be a student at Millikin, and was the

years old – not married) so were thrilled to have him over. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I

leaving the middle of Aug to take a teaching position in Missouri.
Mon evening I cooked on the grill.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
took the kids in for a measles shot this week; they have to have two
more to complete the series. Ruth ordered her tinted glasses, but
they hadn’t come in by yesterday. She hoped to have them for the
trip. She took the girls down for haircuts yesterday.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
plan to stay in Seneca tomorrow night at the Starlight Motel, I
believe. We have a reservation. Sun morning we’ll go on to
Manhatten and visit Deloris Musgrave Berland and family. We’ll
probably eat lunch with them. We drove by there last year but they
were not at home. We’ll drive on to Oberlin Sun night. We’ll
probably leave for Hutchinson Wed, and try to leave for Kansas City
on Sat. We may try to attend our old church on Sun in Kansas City.
We’ll come on back here on Mon. Sorry we can’t stay any longer,
but we wanted to do the trip East, also, this year. Hope you’re all
OK.</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>

hot and humid.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Aunt
Lenore (Mrs. L sister in Miami, Fla) stopped by some yesterday

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth

Columbia, Missouri at the med center eye clinic where he is a
resident in ophthalmology. It rained on the way to St. Louis. We
stopped for about 3 hours in St. Louis and visited the zoo. Didn’t
grandpa go to the St. Louis worlds fair – it was held on the
present zoo grounds, I guess. We had planned to go sometime but
didn’t know we would this trip. Home about 9:00 PM. Glad we saw you

As usual I didn’t get this off when I expected to. Everything is
fine here. The weather has been cool the last few days after that hot
streak but certainly the summer hasn’t been bad so far. I always
say we’ll get central air conditioning next year but that’s not a
certainty. It’s only when it gets above 90 that you could really
use it. Of course I’m not in the house all day but at work where
its air conditioned. We finally got the screens for the car windows,
so we should be cool on the trip East.</FONT></FONT></P>

the meetings, and before John and his family return from there

a side trip such as up to Boston. We’ll probably spend at least a

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
to have your letter this week. Hope M.J. and Bill have a good trip. I
think maybe we went by Stephens College in Columbia. The kids enjoyed
the St. Louis Zoo. We were there in time to see the lion show which
has a 76 year old lion tamer. If John went to Indiana from Kansas he
might have gone through Decatur. I read in the KU newsletter where
Dr. Barne’s (the one at Seneca) son was killed in an auto accident.
I think the kids did real well traveling. They were really fussy only
a few times. They have really been full of life since we got home.
Yesterday Andy really showed his temper about everything. He’s
really Daddy’s boy right now.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
have some more responsibility at work. I’m in charge of all the
cardiovascular testing. I was doing a lot of it but I now have the
initial testing to do which was being done by that lady. She now
works under our new pharmacologist (Dr. Moffitt he’s 41-42 yrs old
and just finished his PhD from the University of Louisville, Ky, but
he’s had 11 yrs of previous experience at another drug company) and
they are in charge of the areas of testing other than mine. I should
eventually have a second technician, and we should grow beyond that
eventually as more of the Union Carbide chemicals (from 3 of their
labs) come into here for testing. We receive chemicals from their
labs in Belgium, Charleston, W. Virginia and Tarrytown, NY. In
addition, we have the chemicals to test that are made here. Hope
you’re all OK and not to hot. Sorry we couldn’t stay longer in
Kansas.</FONT></FONT></P>

Dear Aunt Clara and Mother, I’ll send this letter to you since I
don’t believe I’ve sent one to you since we got back. We were
glad to have Mother’s letter this week. Hope you’re all feeling
OK and are not too hot. Yesterday and today have been real hot here
(in the 90’s) after a cooler spell. I use the air conditioner in
the car even on short trips – it cools it down in just a few
minutes. I think I wrote that we got the aluminum screens for the car
windows. We’ve used them already and the’re a big help.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Everything
at work is about the same. I’ve done quite a bit of writing at the

vacation break. We’ll leave here the morning of Sun the 15</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
and go straight East of US 36 to Indianapolis. We may stop a few
minutes in Rockville, Ind to visit some of Ruths relatives. I guess
all of my distant relatives were more in the Southern part of the
state. We’ll stay Sun night in Ohio, probably near Gainsville. Mon
we’ll go straight on to Philadelphia and will stay Mon-Thurs nights
in the University Dormitories. I can be reached at the Fall
Pharmacology Meeting, Department of Pharmacology, University of
Pennsylvania, School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pa.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
meetings are over on Fri and we may or may not stay in the
dormitories that night. Ruth’s older brother John and his family
hope to be back Sun night from their vacation. They said we could
stay at their house until they got back and sent us a key but we
might take a side trip rather than going on in their house. Their
address is John F Laidig 178 Meyerville Road, Chatham, New Jersey.
We’ll have Mon and Tues with them and will drive back on Wed and
Thurs. I hope to be back to work on Fri.</FONT></FONT></P>

Alan hit a table and had about a half inch cut on his head which we

OK. Glad M.J. and Bill got back OK. I wrote our schedule in the last
letter. We won’t stop in Rockville, Ind on the way but on the way
back. Thanks for the post cards. The meeting should be more relaxing
this year since I won’t have a paper to give. I think I wrote that
I’ll miss the meeting the’re having here to orient some of the
top Carbide chemists in regard to drug development. I would have
given a talk to them about my work.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
has been doing a lot of sewing and knitting recently. Andy has added
several new words to his vocabulary but still has quite a temper,
especially at meals, when he doesn’t get his way. We let him play
alone some in front of the house when we’re near enough to keep an
eye on him. He’s been pretty good about staying close. We didn’t
get but about a month and a half use out of the little fenced in area
we made.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
haven’t done much unusual this week. We received the pillow OK.
Thanks. We noticed it missing soon after we’d gone. Had a letter
from Lee Murray asking about some card magic books. I guess he does a
lot of card tricks when they play bridge. Hope M.J. and Jimmy feel OK
now. I guess Philadelphia and New York are having quite a water
shortage. I remember reading about the new Cheney Reservoir. Ruth
sure enjoys her dark glasses with the correction. Went to church as
usual last Sun. Guess that’s about it. We leave Sun morning.</FONT></FONT></P>

Dear Hutch Folks, Made it OK. Stopped in Zanesville, Ohio on the way.
It turned hot and humid as we left so the air conditioner and screens
were a big help. A lot of cars overheated on the Penn. Turnpike where
it goes up in altitude but we made it OK. Has been hot and humid here
also. The former JoAnn Stokes (M.J. knows her, I believe) married an
MD who became a pharmacologist at KU Med Center. They are here with
their children also. Had a piano recital last night which was very
good. It was for the meeting. Will go on to John Laidigs (Chatham NJ
178 Meyerville Rd) Fri.</FONT></FONT></P>

Dear Hutch Folks, We just arrived OK here at Chatham, NJ. We’ve
forgotten how to find Johns house so we’ll have to ask directions.
Philadelphia was very hot and humid until today. Saw Independence
Hall this AM. Visited colonial homes yesterday. Yes, I did go to some
of the sessions. We’ll probably stay here through Tues and drive
back on Wed and Thurs. John’s expect to be back Sun night. Hope
you’re OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Fri PM -</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
Dear Hutch Folks, I thought I’d mail this card after we got back.
As you can see I carried it around in my pocket for the whole trip.
We got back OK last night as we had planned. About 9:45 by our time
here, or 10:45 by the time in New Jersey. Everything went OK.
Followed the plan I gave. We rested Sat and Sun at John’s and they
came in about supper time Sun night. Had a good visit with them and
they kept Andy and Alan (he said at the time he didn’t want to go)
while we went to the fair on Tues. Didn’t leave their house till
2:00 PM Wed, so it hurried us so I could work today.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>9-2-65

Dear Mother, Aunt Clara, M.J. and Bill, I guess I should write a
letter this time </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>(the
last few were postcards)</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>.
Haven’t received one from Hutchinson yet but suppose that we might
today. The last few mornings have been cool and you can tell that
fall is almost here. Rainfall for Aug set a record here so when we
got back the grass was all green and had really grown, partially
because I’d put some fertilizer on before we left. The cat got
along OK while we were gone. It stayed in the garage and Laura
Brenneman (former baby sitter home from college) fed it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Although
the trip was tiring part of the time, we were glad we all went. We
did more sightseeing than we’ve usually done on trips and, of
course, we were near places to see more so than on other trips. The
crowd was good the day we were at the fair, and it wasn’t too hot.
</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Vivid
memories of the “It’s A Small World” exhibit and ride at the
fair. </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
guess the crowds have been disappointing part of the time. I guess
Chicago had plans for a fair, but they have decided not to go ahead
because of the New York difficulties. We missed our turn after
leaving the fair so it took us awhile longer to get across Manhatten.
It was at night so the lack of traffic helped. It was my first time,
of course, to drive in New York City. We went through the Holland
Tunnel going over to Manhatten and then crossed one of the big
bridges over to Brooklyn and Queens. The fair is in Flushing park, I
believe, which is in the Queens. John’s, of course, drive all over
the New York area so he gave us the best route from their house.
After driving in metropolitan areas for awhile I’m glad we live in
a smaller place.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>In
Philadelphia we stayed in the dormitory and were near several other
families with children. The wives took turns baby sitting so they
could get away some during the day. We took that colonial home tour
on Thurs morning. I was the only man but it was interesting. I went
to sessions Tues Wed and Thurs afternoon. Wed PM I visited a man in
the veterinary school who does some things that I’m interested in.
Tues night was the piano recital, and Wed night Ruth and I drove to
downtown Phil and ate there rather than at the regular banquet which
they said wasn’t air conditioned. It was still hot then and on
Thurs.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Thurs
night we drove around some with the kids and ate at a drive-in. It
rained then and by Fri the smog had cleared and it was cooler. Fri
morning we saw Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell and went through
the Wax Museum (figures in American History). Ate downtown Phil and
drove on to Johns. Rested Sat and Sun. Tried to go to church Sun, but
were too late so took a ride.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Mon
Esther tried to take us to a childrens museum but it was closed. She
took Alan and Andy back when we went to the fair. Mon PM she drove
Ruth and me to the area where they will be moving. John is being
transferred to new labs about 40-50 mi away. Tues was the fair. Wed
AM we visited the pottery shop, and then ate lunch there before
leaving about 2:00. Stopped in Rockville Ind Thurs night. The storms
that night were to the north of us. Went to work on time Fri.
Received your card at Johns. We’ll go over to the covered bridge
festival at Rockville in Oct. Hope you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

– </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Glad
to have your letter this week and to know that everything is OK. I
don’t have the letter here so I can’t remember any questions you
may have asked. Yesterday and today have been warmer and humid but I
suppose it will turn cool one of these days.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Lisa
was real pleased to receive your birthday card and, of course, was
excited this morning when she got up, about her being six yrs old. I
think Ruth has made her a new dress and she bought her a new doll
buggy, and some other presents. As usual, we’ll have the presents
this evening.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
girls are real pleased with school. Mound School has the largest
enrollment in the city and, as you may remember, they are building
two new grade schools to take its place. They should be ready by next
year and then Mound will become a junior high. I think the junior
highs, at the present, are just two years but might go to three yrs
if the high schools become crowded. Next year, if the new schools are
completed, Lesle and Lisa will have to take Alan with them and walk
several blocks. They say that one of the kindergarten classes is
being transported to another school this year. One of the reasons we
bought our present house was, of course, because of the proximity to
the grade school. We can’t complain, however, because we will have
had 5 total school years in the early grades when it would have been
harder for them to walk. Decatur is growing quite a bit in our
direction, so the number of children has gone up quite a bit.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>We
had a real fireplace man look at our fireplace, and he said it would
take $700 to put it in order so it would work properly. When we
bought the house apparently the former owners had not made it clear
(on purpose) to the real estate man the degree of work needed to make
it a safe good fireplace. He had an estimate of $200 and they came
down in price by $200, apparently knowing all the time it was
actually a much bigger job to fix it right. Anyway, we won’t fix it
now, since a fire in the fireplace is pretty much just luxury. We do
plan, however, to build bookcases and storage on the side of the
living room where the fireplace is. We’ll do that before long. I
started painting the kitchen walls (not ceiling) a turquoise, which
just matches the refrigerator. We have a new copper tone sink
ordered, and that will fix up the kitchen for now. We may change it
later if we stay in the house and make the garage into a family room.
Our old sink is about worn out from our water.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I’m
sure you did the right thing by having the apartment painted. We had
the first choir practice last night. The kids came home with some
colds but are over them now. Andy is OK, but we can’t let him out
when the people drive up for school. Stayed home over the labor day
weekend and worked around the house etc. Took kids to the park a
couple of times. Hope you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Dear Aunt Clara, Mother, M.J. and Bill, I guess it’s about your
turn to have a letter. We were glad to have Mother’s long letter
this week. We had a lot of rain last night and this morning and two
nights ago we had quite a storm. I guess they had a tornado at Peoria
with a lot of damage. We saw a few little tornadoes up in the clouds
one day last summer, but they didn’t touch the ground. We haven’t
had to water since we came back from the East, since we’ve had so
much rain.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Lesle
and Lisa are still enjoying school. Ruth shortened Lisa’s dress
(birthday from Mother) some and she has worn it to school. Ruth has
made her a new dress, also, and is doing some more school and
personal sewing at the present. We were sorry to hear about Paul
Wheaton. I remember him very well. Was he a congregational minister?

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
suppose the State Fair is on now. We watched part of the Miss America
contest last Sat night when Miss Kansas won. They said she had gone
to Christian College at Columbia, Mo, which, I guess, is a private
girls Jr. College, like Stephens College where Ola went. We drove by
it when we were in Columbia.</FONT></FONT></P>

supposed to come through here on the way to Florida this fall
sometime. I can’t recall the years I worked with the Erector Set.
We tried to talk Lesle into a French class (a girl her age at church
takes it and they have an opening) but she didn’t seem interested.
Ruth says the only way to really speak another language is to start
at an early age.</FONT></FONT></P>

guess its been two weeks now since I wrote last. We haven’t had
anything happen or I would have written sooner. Today is rainy. I
picked up my new all-weather coat, with a zip-in lining, yesterday
when I was downtown for a dental check-up. The coat will look a lot
better than the old plastic raincoat that I’ve had for many years.
I must have got it while I was still in college, or before. With the
zip-in lining it will be warm enough for cold weather, also. You can
figure your gift as applying on it ($24), or on a new pair of pants
I’ll get shortly. I think I told you that Ruth got me a new attache
case with her stamps from Krogers. It is grey and is like a small
suitcase. I’ve carried the old briefcase (I think you got it for me
in about 1953) almost continuously for 12 years, and it was all worn
out and didn’t look very good. She finished a summer sport shirt to
match the shirts she had made for the rest of the family and she also
finished a red vest she had started earlier. The other things I got
were some underwear, and a pair of pajamas she made.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
didn’t have any cavities so I’ve gone for a year without any
trouble. You may remember I had some work about 2 yrs ago after I
hadn’t been to a dentist for about 5 yrs. The kids all had their
eye check-ups. Lisa is to wait another year before possibly doing
anything but will most likely be near-sighted. Lesle most likely will
be but is OK for now. There is no indication, as yet, that Alan will.
They can’t tell for sure at an early age. Last Sat we went to the
Mound School PTA round-up (to raise money). In the afternoon we all
went to a magic show which the kids enjoyed. After their naps we went
back and saw the rest of it and ate supper. It was nice talking to
you on the phone and glad to hear about everything. Come up a few
days if you want to. If you would go to St. Louis or to Galesburg (I

Mother who is 84. After that we drove everyone (there were 10 in the

painting for the living room. We ate at a drive-in on the way home
and got here about 9:30. This afternoon I softened the water and we
then rearranged the living room. We put the piano on the South wall
where the bookshelves were, and moved the bookshelves on the east.
The new picture will go on the east. Last Sun night I layed one of
these wall to wall carpets (inexpensive) in the bathroom. They can be
taken up and washed, of course. Our next project is to have a plumber
install the copper tone kitchen sink we got and then have a shower
put in before the bathroom is painted </FONT></FONT>

good, which is most of the time. He thinks he can do everything and
go everywhere the big kids go. I remember all the Crebs relics. I
didn’t watch the Pope except as I saw it on the news. Hope you’re
all OK. Ruth is still knitting a lot.</FONT></FONT></P>

– Fri AM - </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
meant to write the Hutchinson letter yesterday, but, as usual, just
didn’t get it off. I am earlier than last week when I didn’t mail
it until Sun night. I suppose we may have a letter from Mother today.
You would have enjoyed the covered bridge festival where we went last
Sat. I guess I wrote about it in that last letter. They have a lot of
covered bridges in the county where the town of Rockville is. I guess
they have some of the bridges in other parts of the state but I don’t
know whether they have any in the South where our relatives come
from. Our weather has been warmer again and the kids had a big time
playing out in the yard yesterday. They had vacation yesterday and
today because of the Teachers’ Meeting. They found a toad out in
the garden yesterday and were quite thrilled. Lesle really rides her
bicycle now although she still has the training wheels on. We have
trouble with Andy wanting to go into the street when Lesle is out
there riding or one of the other kids gets out. As you remember we’re
on a dead end street so its not too bad although we’re teaching him
not to go out. Andy tries to do everything the older kids do and
usually just about succeeds.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
may have mentioned that I am to get a second technician shortly. This
will give me two and its possible I might have a third sometime in
the coming year if we expand any. We will be testing the chemicals
made by the chemists here plus a regular load of chemicals from some
of the other Union Carbide laboratories back East. Neisler is a
separate subsidiary so there is no indication that we will ever be
moved from Decatur although you never know with a big corporation. I
guess the sales of Union Carbide will go over 2 billion this year. It
is the second largest (DuPont is first) chemical corporation. At the
present I’m quite content with my work.</FONT></FONT></P>

is Community Concert – a pianist. Wed night we went to choir

Council of Churches class on finding out about small discussion
groups. Tomorrow AM we may watch a parade of old cars. Sun night is
the Mariners group at the church and Mon Pete (my technician) and I
are driving to St. Louis to see a man and also deliver a dog for
someone else here. Hope everyone in Hutch is fine.</FONT></FONT></P>

I’m writing just after lunch. We went downtown this morning and saw
the Millikin U Homecoming Parade. We then went shopping and all the
“men” in the family bought new trousers. Mine was supposed to be
part of my birthday. I sure enjoy my all-weather coat. I guess
they’re selling a lot of them for women too. Today is windy and
cooler although it cleared off for the parade. It had been cloudy and
rainy yesterday. Yesterday morning our friend Ted Jensen ran into Don
Heitmeiers car about two blocks from here. It dented his side about
$200 worth. It was slick and both cars skidded on the wet pavement.
They probably wouldn’t have hit on a dry pavement. Harold White and
I were in Don’s car and we were on the way to get Lowell Miller –
the other carpool member. I walked home and got our car and drove
everybody the rest of the day. The fan motor gave out yesterday on
the furnace but we got it fixed quickly so the furnace is in good
shape for the rest of the winter. We had never had it checked since
we had moved in so it needed a check-up anyway.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Our
trip (Pete Luna my technician went along) to St. Louis last Mon went
OK. We went to see how a pharmacologist down there does something. We
delivered a dog to him and also brought back a big wooden stand for
conscious dogs to stand on while we test them. Everything at work is
fine. I should have my second technician in a week or so. Tues night
Ruth had a PTA board meeting and her math class over at Mound and I
went to the School of Christian Living. Wed night the choir had a
picnic supper at one of the choir member’s house and then we had
rehersal afterwards. Thurs night Ruth went to PTA and I babysat. Last
night we stayed home and had a soft drink and popcorn treat. </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0070c0"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The

Tomorrow night I sing in the choir at a United Church Service. Ruth
won’t try to go. Last Sun afternoon I went to practice for it, and
then we had Mariners at the church in the evening. It will be
exciting watching M.J. and Bill’s new house be built. Glad to have
your letter. Last Fri night (wk ago) was community concert with Claud
Frank the pianist. Glad to hear all the Hutch new. Tell all hello.</FONT></FONT></P>

Ruth is finishing up Alan’s Halloween costume – a spider. The

good for another year.</FONT></FONT></P>

weekend I cleaned the basement, so it looks a lot better. Last Sun
evening was that church service. I sang in the big choir. I’ll

Living. I think I mentioned that I’m attending the class about
small discussion groups. Thurs night was a church dinner with a
speaker. Last evening we stayed home and had a popcorn treat. We’ve
done that on several Fri nights letting the kids stay up late and
watch TV.</FONT></FONT></P>

from the other kids.</FONT></FONT></P>

to have your letter this week. What kind of a heart operation did
Mrs. Fotopoulis have? Glad to hear all the other news. Sounds like
you’re as busy as ever. I guess KU and K State play each other
today in football. I guess neither team has done very well this year.
We’re going to work on the antique clock before long. Will probably
finish it first. Andy talks more all the time but I’ve had no luck
with my Sat morning “training” sessions ha! Hope you’re all OK</FONT></FONT></P>

– Sat AM - </B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
guess I’ve gotten in the habit of writing on Sat mornings any more.
I used to write some of the letters just after I got to work in the
morning and was alert ? but I’ve been pretty busy there. We’re
shampooing the carpet this morning. We hadn’t really planned to do
it today but the kids spilled some of the red grease paint they used
for Halloween on the carpet and it looks pretty bad. We had never
done it since we’ve lived here so it needed it. We had planned to
hire it done but that’s pretty expensive, although, of course, it
would be a better job.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>The
Laidigs will be here next week-end. They may stay 3-4 days. I guess
the last time they were here was just before you were here last
spring. Last weekend I made the planter box for Esther so they can
take it with them when they go back east.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Today
is quite warm so the kids are playing outside. We’re all free of
colds right now. I may wash and clean the car this afternoon since
this may be just about our last warm week-end. Glad to have your
letter. We don’t get as many trick-or-treaters out here as you do
since we’re kinda off the “beaten track.” It was warm here last
Sat night (they all went out on Sat PM, rather than Sun.), unlike the
last Halloweens which were quite cold. Like the kids there, our kids
had a big time. We only went to houses where they knew the people.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Sun
we all went to church as usual. We’re to have a new minister here
to preach later this month and I guess he will be voted on at that
time. We were home Mon night. Tues night I had my last class. I went
to 4 of the 5 classes so I got credit for the course. Ruth has 2 more
of her Tues night math classes. Wed was choir practice as usual.
Thurs night we went to a local high school auditorium to see the
local Theatre 7 Group present “Born Yesterday.” It was very
funny.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
night we all ate at the Redwood Restaurant. Thats where we ate with
you once, I believe, or at least when M.J., Aunt Clara and Bill were
here. It’s a good place for the kids. Afterwards we picked up new
bathtub and shower fixtures at Sears. We need a plumber now to
install them and the kitchen sink.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
recall playing in a lot of trumpet trios at various places. Our
accident was not in the paper. Only about $200 damage to the car I
was in but the parts haven’t arrived yet, so he rides with us every

It was nice talking to everyone on Thanksgiving. We didn’t do much
the rest of the day. We rested in the afternoon and then cleaned the
boys’ room. The kids stayed up later since they didn’t have
school on Fri.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Yesterday
was warmer and cloudy. In the afternoon Ruth took the girls for
haircuts and then she had her first Drs. appointment to get at the
bottom of what she’s allergic to. He is not our family Dr., but is
about the only one in town who does allergy work. He thought she
definitely has an allergy. It was so late when they got through that
they didn’t have time to go out to Kemmerer Home to get Dennis
Harding before I got home. As soon as I got home we all started for
Assumption (25 miles south) where the home is located. It rained
quite hard on the way so I was glad Ruth hadn’t gone alone. Dennis
had eaten supper but we planned to eat at the Redwood. Andy got
carsick on the way back and vomited on Ruth’s coat so we came on
home and I went to the drive-in for supper.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Afterwards,
we had our usual Fri night popcorn treat. Dennis slept in Alan’s
bed, Alan slept in Andy’s and Andy slept in the crib which we still
have up in our bedroom for his naps. This morning we all went to the
parade downtown. (It is colder and clear today). Santa Claus and
those big balloon characters. We stopped at the store on the way
home. Tomorrow we’ll all go to church and then take Dennis back out
in the afternoon before the Advent Sing at church. Dennis would have
been here for Thanksgiving but went to his home in Springfield. We
don’t know what the reason is for his being in the home. He’s 10
years old.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
can’t think of whats on this coming week. Advent Sing and we’ll
be in the adult choir, of course. Last Sat afternoon we went to the
reception at church for the new minister. He preached at both of the

meeting afterwards. He will come Feb 1</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>st</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Sat night we had company (2 couples) in for dessert. They had both
eaten out before. I picked up drive-in food on the way home from the
reception at church. Sun night was Mariners at church. Just dessert
and Dr. Martin (interim minister) spoke. I may have mentioned that
Ruth and I are in charge of Mariners for the coming year. Ruth went
to creative writing on Mon night and that was it for last week except
for choir on Wed night. Hope you’re all OK.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
just got home from downtown where I did some shopping. I gave Ruth
one of her Christmas presents in advance – a large colonial style
bucket for her knitting. I don’t know whether she’ll get all her
Christmas knitting done or not but I guess she’ll try. I bought a
new winter suit. The suit I’ve been wearing in the winter has a Gus
Meschke label so I guess I haven’t had one since. I think it was
about 5 years ago. I’ve had a new summer suit more recently.</FONT></FONT></P>

Sat AM I took Andy and we went to the post office to mail Dennis

Dear Mary Janet, Bill, Mother and Aunt Clara, As I told Ruth I guess
I should address at least one of the Hutchinson letters that I write
every year to my sister. We just got back from shopping. I took the
girls down to their choir rehersal. They sing tomorrow at church. I
came back home and then got Ruth and the boys and we went downtown. I
left Ruth picked up the girls and then drove around and around
waiting for Ruth. The weather is good today so I’m sure it was the
biggest crowd of the year. We got the Texas package off (Judy Laidig
Moats and Delbert Musgrave – he’s in Vietnam – wife and child).
The Laidigs took most of the New Jersey things, so we still have a
small package for there, the Hutchinson things, and the Colorado
(Eldon Laidig) things.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
called Oberlin this morning for the Texas address so we know that Mr.
and Mrs. Laidig got home OK from their long trip. They came here (you
may remember they had their accident when they were leaving Decatur),
went to New Jersey, then to Florida (Mrs. L’s sisters 50</FONT></FONT><SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>
wedding anniversary in Miami) on to the Texas folks and were back
home by Wed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Ruth
said Mother’s letter came yesterday but I don’t believe I read
it. I suppose it will turn up. We’re always glad to hear about the
Collins doing via Mother’s letters. Its 7:00 PM now. Ruth took the
girls out for new red shoes this afternoon. This evening we go to
some friends house for a tree trimming party. Ruth is working on the
Christmas cards. She made them again this year. I believe she made
more of the gifts this year, also. She’s done quite a bit of
knitting the past year, with a lot of it for Christmas.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Tomorrow
afternoon we go to one of our neighbors open house and then everyone
goes to a Christmas party at church for the kids. Wed night we’ll
go caroling after choir practice. I am off work both Thurs PM and Fri
before both Christmas and New Years.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Last
Sat night we went out to some friends. They are fairly new here, and
he teaches at Millikin. They live in an appartment. Last Sun morning
Ruth stayed home with Lisa and Andy. Lisa had some intestinal flu. In
fact we all had a touch at one time or another in the past week or
so. I stayed home in the afternoon while Ruth took Lesle and Alan to
the Christmas vespers at Millikin. We were home Mon and Tues nights.
Wed night was choir practice. Thurs night was the Neisler Christmas
party. We had about 20 Neisler people in after the party. Last night
I went to church to help in some decorating sponsered by Mariners –
the couples group.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><FONT FACE="Century Schoolbook, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>I
